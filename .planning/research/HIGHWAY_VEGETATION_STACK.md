# Technology Stack: Charlotte NC Highway Vegetation

**Project:** Charlotte Digital Twin - Highway Roadside Vegetation
**Researched:** 2026-02-22

## Recommended Vegetation Stack

### Turf Grasses (Active Zone - Near Roadway)

| Species | Type | Seasonal Color | Texture | Coverage |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| **Bermudagrass** (Cynodon dactylon) | Warm-season | Bright emerald (summer) / Tan-brown (winter dormant) | Medium-fine, dense | ~60% of maintained turf |
| **Tall Fescue** (Festuca arundinacea) | Cool-season | Dark green year-round | Coarse, wide blades | ~30% of maintained turf |
| **Zoysiagrass** (Zoysia spp.) | Warm-season | Yellow-green to olive (summer) / Golden-brown (winter) | Fine to medium, cushion-like | ~10% specialty areas |

**Rationale:** Charlotte sits in the transition zone where both warm and cool-season grasses grow. Bermudagrass dominates due to heat tolerance and rapid growth. Tall Fescue provides year-round green in shaded areas. NC State Extension confirms ~80% of Charlotte lawns use Tall Fescue, but highway applications favor Bermudagrass for durability.

### Native Warm-Season Grasses (Passive Zone - Naturalized Areas)

| Species | Height | Seasonal Interest | Use Case |
|---------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Switchgrass** (Panicum virgatum) | 3-6 ft | Airy seed heads late summer/fall | Erosion control, soil stabilization |
| **Little Bluestem** (Schizachyrium scoparium) | 2-4 ft | Blue-green summer → Orange-red fall | Visual interest, drought tolerance |
| **Indiangrass** (Sorghastrum nutans) | 3-5 ft | Golden plumes in fall | Vertical accent, wildlife habitat |
| **River Oats** (Chasmanthium latifolium) | 2-4 ft | Bamboo-like foliage, flat seed heads | Shady areas, texture contrast |
| **Purple Lovegrass** (Eragrostis spectabilis) | 1-2 ft | Purple-red summer blooms | Low-growing accent, fine texture |
| **Broomsedge Bluestem** (Andropogon virginicus) | 2-4 ft | Coppery fall color, fluffy seed heads | Naturalized areas, minimal maintenance |

**Rationale:** Deep root systems provide erosion control on slopes. Native grasses require less water, fertilizer, and maintenance. Wilson's Natural Landscaping confirms these species are well-adapted to Charlotte's Piedmont climate.

### Highway Trees (Medians and Beyond Clear Zones)

#### Evergreen Trees

| Species | Height | Needle Characteristics | Common Use |
|---------|--------|------------------------|------------|
| **Loblolly Pine** (Pinus taeda) | 60-100+ ft | Yellow-green, 3 per bundle, 6-9" long | Most common roadside pine in Piedmont |
| **Shortleaf Pine** (Pinus echinata) | 50-80 ft | 2 per bundle, shorter than loblolly | Widespread, drought-tolerant |
| **Longleaf Pine** (Pinus palustris) | 60-120 ft | Dark green, 3 per bundle, 8-18" long | Coastal Plain, distinctive feathery look |
| **Eastern Red Cedar** (Juniperus virginiana) | 30-40 ft | Scale-like, dark green | Native evergreen, wildlife value |

#### Deciduous Trees

| Species | Height | Leaf Characteristics | Fall Color | Common Use |
|---------|--------|---------------------|------------|------------|
| **Willow Oak** (Quercus phellos) | 40-60 ft | Narrow, willow-like leaves | Yellow-brown | Fast-growing street/highway tree |
| **Northern Red Oak** (Quercus rubra) | 60-75 ft | Large, lobed leaves | Reddish-brown | Hardy, long-lived |
| **White Oak** (Quercus alba) | 60-100 ft | Rounded lobes, classic oak | Wine-red to brown | Majestic shade tree |
| **Sweetgum** (Liquidambar styraciflua) | 60-75 ft | Star-shaped leaves | Yellow/red/purple mix | Distinctive shape, adaptable |
| **Tulip Poplar** (Liriodendron tulipifera) | 70-90 ft | Unique tulip-shaped leaves | Clear yellow | Fast-growing, NC native |
| **Red Maple** (Acer rubrum) | 40-60 ft | 3-5 lobed leaves | Brilliant red | Most common eastern US tree |

**Rationale:** FHWA NC Native Plants list confirms all species above are recommended for roadside planting. Loblolly Pine dominates Charlotte highways. Oaks and Sweetgum provide canopy diversity.

### Shrubs and Groundcover

#### Native Shrubs

| Species | Height | Characteristics | Use Case |
|---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Fragrant Sumac** (Rhus aromatica) | 2-6 ft | Tricolored leaves, red fall color | Slope stabilization, low hedge |
| **Wax Myrtle** (Myrica cerifera) | 6-12 ft | Evergreen, aromatic foliage | Screening, wildlife value |
| **Carolina Rose** (Rosa carolina) | 3-6 ft | Pink flowers, red hips | Native rose for naturalizing |
| **Swamp Rose** (Rosa palustris) | 3-6 ft | Pink flowers, wet soil tolerant | Drainage areas |
| **Winterberry** (Ilex verticillata) | 6-10 ft | Red berries persist into winter | Winter interest, wildlife |

#### Groundcover Junipers

| Species | Height | Foliage Color | Use Case |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Shore Juniper** (Juniperus rigida 'Blue Pacific') | 6-12" | Silvery-blue | Salt-tolerant, full sun |
| **Common Juniper** (Juniperus communis) | Variable | Dark green to blue-green | Hardy native |

**Rationale:** Native shrubs from FHWA list provide erosion control, wildlife habitat, and visual screening. Juniper groundcovers handle tough roadside conditions.

### Urban Ornamental Trees (Interchanges, Exits)

| Species | Height | Features | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Crape Myrtle** (Lagerstroemia indica) | 15-25 ft | Summer blooms 120 days, pollution tolerant | Highway interchanges, urban areas |
| **Flowering Dogwood** (Cornus florida) | 15-30 ft | NC state flower, white/pink bracts | Spring interest, native |
| **Eastern Redbud** (Cercis canadensis) | 20-30 ft | Pink-purple early spring flowers | Spring color, native |

**Rationale:** Crape Myrtles are extensively used in Charlotte urban landscaping due to long bloom period and pollution tolerance. Dogwood and Redbud are native alternatives.

## Seasonal Color Reference

| Summer (Jun-Aug) | Bright emerald green | Dense, uniform | Peak growing season |
| Fall (Sep-Oct) | Fading green to yellow | Thinning | Growth slows |
| Winter (Nov-Mar) | Tan to straw brown | Dormant | Completely brown, not dead |

### Tall Fescue Seasonal Cycle
| Season | Color | Texture | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| Spring | Dark green, vibrant | Coarse | Fastest growth period |
| Summer | Dark green (may fade without water) | Coarse | Susceptible to heat stress |
| Fall | Deep green | Coarse | Best growing season |
| Winter | Dark green (slower growth) | Coarse | Stays green year-round |

### Native Grasses Fall Interest

| Indiangrass | Golden yellow | Towering golden plumes |
| Switchgrass | Yellow-brown | Airy, open panicles |
| Broomsedge | Coppery bronze | Fluffy white seed heads |

## Alternatives Considered

| Category | Recommended | Alternative | Why Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Turf | Bermudagrass | St. Augustinegrass | Less cold-hardy for Charlotte winters |
| Turf | Tall Fescue | Kentucky Bluegrass | Poor heat tolerance in NC summers |
| Native Grass | Switchgrass | Miscanthus | Miscanthus is invasive in some areas |
| Tree | Loblolly Pine | Virginia Pine | Slower growing, less adaptable |
| Shrub | Native roses | Knockout Rose | Knockout is cultivated, not native |
