# Duke Energy Center Charlotte LED Facade System - Research Report

**Research Date:** 2026-02-22
**Subject:** 550 South Tryon (formerly Duke Energy Center) LED Facade System
**Location:** 550 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC
**Mode:** Ecosystem (Technical Documentation + Visual Reference Discovery)

---

## Executive Summary

The Duke Energy Center (now 550 South Tryon / Wells Fargo Tower) features one of the most sophisticated architectural LED facade lighting systems in the United States. Installed in 2010, the system combines programmable color-changing LEDs with metal halide luminaires to create dynamic light shows visible across Charlotte's skyline. The building is nicknamed "The Jukebox" for its distinctive rounded top and lighting capabilities.

**Key Discovery:** This is NOT a high-resolution LED video wall but rather an architectural lighting system with programmable color zones. The system uses ~2,500 LED fixtures running vertically up the 48-story building, with total LED counts exceeding 45,000 individual lights when considering all facade elements.
