## Executive Summary

Charlotte, NC ("The Queen City") has a concentrated, photogenic skyline dominated by banking towers. The three most iconic buildings are:

1. **Bank of America Corporate Center** - The tallest (265m/871ft, 60 floors), distinctive granite crown
2. **Duke Energy Center** (550 South Tryon) - The crystalline LED tower (240m/786ft, 48 floors)
3. **One Wells Fargo Center** (301 South College) - The "Jukebox" with rounded top (179m/588ft, 42 floors)

Charlotte is the second-largest banking center in the US after New York City, which explains the concentration of headquarters towers in a relatively compact downtown ("Uptown") area.

### 3D Modeling Tips
1. **Proportions:** Model the setbacks carefully - they give the building its elegant taper
2. **Crown:** The illuminated crown is the signature feature - use emissive materials
3. **Facade:** Granite cladding with regular window grid - can use texture mapping
4. **Context:** Model with Founders Hall connection at base

## 3D Modeling Workflow Recommendations

### Phase 1: Reference Gathering
1. Download high-res photos from Wikimedia Commons
2. Capture Google Earth 3D views for proportions
3. Study CTBUH photos for architectural details

### Phase 2: Blocking
1. Start with accurate height ratios (BoA: 265m, Duke: 240m, Wells: 179m)
2. Block in basic forms with correct setbacks
3. Position buildings in correct geographic relationship

### Phase 3: Detailing
1. Model signature features (BoA crown, Duke handlebar, Wells rounded top)
2. Add facade patterns using texture mapping or geometry nodes
3. Create LOD versions for distance rendering

### Phase 4: Materials
1. Granite material for BoA Center (rosy beige, polished)
2. Glass materials with correct tint values
3. Emissive materials for LED systems (Duke Energy)

### Phase 5: Lighting
1. Day renders: Study sun angle shadows
2. Night renders: Critical for Duke Energy LED display
3. BoA crown illumination (blue for Panthers games)

## Confidence Assessment

| Building | Confidence | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Bank of America Corporate Center | HIGH | Wikipedia, CTBUH, e-architect all verified |
| Duke Energy Center (550 S Tryon) | HIGH | CTBUH has extensive documentation |
| One Wells Fargo Center (301 S College) | MEDIUM | Less detailed documentation, verified via CTBUH ranking list |

**Note on naming confusion:** The term "Wells Fargo Capital Center" from the original query does not appear to be an official building name. The 42-floor, ~176-179m Wells Fargo building in Charlotte is "One Wells Fargo Center" located at 301 South College Street.
