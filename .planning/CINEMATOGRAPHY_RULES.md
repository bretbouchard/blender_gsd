# Cinematography Rules - Camera + Lighting Integration

## Professional Methodology

### The "Shot" is a Complete Package

Professional DPs (Directors of Photography) don't think about camera and lighting separately. A "shot" is:

```
SHOT = Camera + Lens + Lighting + Framing + Movement + Mood
```

### The 5 Pillars of Every Shot

1. **Lens Choice** - Determines perspective, compression, DOF
2. **Camera Angle** - Determines power, emotion, scale
3. **Lighting Setup** - Determines mood, dimension, time of day
4. **Subject Framing** - Determines focus, story, composition
5. **Camera Movement** - Determines energy, reveal, pacing

## Lens + Lighting Rules (The "Secret Sauce")

### Rule 1: Lens Dictates Lighting Ratio

| Lens Type | Typical Lighting Ratio | Reason |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| Wide (14-24mm) | Low contrast (1:2) | Already dramatic, don't over-light |
| Normal (35-50mm) | Medium (1:3) | Natural, balanced |
| Portrait (85mm) | Higher contrast (1:4) | Compression needs dimension |
| Telephoto (135mm+) | High contrast (1:6) | Flatten with dramatic light |

### Rule 2: F-Stop Dictates Subject Separation

| F-Stop | Use Case | Lighting Approach |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| f/1.4-2 | Dreamy, isolated | Backlight heavy, subject pops |
| f/2.8-4 | Portrait standard | Classic 3-point balanced |
| f/5.6-8 | Environmental | Even lighting, see background |
| f/11-16 | Product/detail | Flat, even, shadowless |

### Rule 3: Camera Height Dictates Key Light Position

| Camera Height | Key Light Position | Why |
|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| Low angle (looking up) | High key, from above | Match the "sun" direction |
| Eye level | 45° key, typical | Natural shadows |
| High angle (looking down) | Low key, fill from below | Avoid nose shadows |

### Rule 4: Shot Size Dictates Lighting Complexity

| Shot Size | Lighting Complexity | Focus |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Extreme Wide | Simple, big sources | Environment visible |
| Wide | 2-3 lights | Establish mood |
| Medium | 3-4 lights | Subject + environment |
| Close-up | 4-5 lights | Skin, eyes, detail |
| ECU (Extreme Close-up) | Ring/soft even | No shadows on skin |

├── F-Stop: f/8-11
├── Lighting: Natural/ambient
└── Focus: Infinity, deep DOF

WIDE (Full body + environment)
├── Lens: 24-35mm
├── F-Stop: f/5.6-8
├── Lighting: Strong ambient + accent
└── Focus: Subject visible in context

MEDIUM (Waist up, "the workhorse")
├── Lens: 35-50mm
├── F-Stop: f/4-5.6
├── Lighting: Classic 3-point
└── Focus: Subject prominent, BG soft

MEDIUM CLOSE-UP (Chest up)

└── Focus: Specific detail only
```

## Camera Angle + Mood + Lighting

### The Power Dynamic Matrix

| Angle | Subject Power | Lighting | Use When |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Low (below eye) | Powerful, dominant | Strong underlight rim | Hero, villain reveal |
| Eye level | Neutral, relatable | Standard 3-point | Dialogue, standard |
| High (above eye) | Vulnerable, small | Soft overhead fill | Victim, confession |
| Dutch tilt | Uneasy, chaos | Harsh, directional | Tension, madness |

### The Emotion Matrix

| Emotion | Camera | Lens | Lighting | Color |
|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Romance | Eye level, soft | 85mm, f/2 | Warm, soft key | Warm (3200K) |
| Tension | Dutch, close | 35mm, f/4 | Hard, high contrast | Cool (5600K+) |
| Power | Low angle | 24mm, f/8 | Strong rim | Neutral |
| Sadness | High angle | 50mm, f/2.8 | Soft, flat | Desaturated |
| Joy | Eye level | 50mm, f/4 | Bright, even | Warm, saturated |
| Fear | POV or extreme angles | Wide, f/2 | Dark, single source | Cold, blue |

## Subject Distance + Framing Rules

### The "Rule of Heads" (Vertical Framing)

```
ECU:     1 head height visible
CU:      1.5-2 heads visible
MCU:     2-3 heads (chest up)
Medium:  3-4 heads (waist up)
Medium Full: 4-6 heads (knees up)
Full:    6-8 heads (full body)
Wide:    Subject is 1/3 of frame height
```

### Subject Positioning (Horizontal)

| Composition | Subject Position | Camera Offset |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Center frame | 50% | 0° (straight on) |
| Rule of thirds | 33% or 66% | 15° angle |
| Off-center (dynamic) | 25% or 75% | 30° angle |
| Looking room | 30% from edge | Match gaze direction |

## Movement + Lens + Lighting

### Static Shot
- Any lens, any f-stop
- Lighting: Controlled, precise
- Use: Dialogue, portraits, product

### Pan/Tilt (Camera rotates)
- Normal to telephoto (35-135mm)
- f/4-8 for deep DOF
- Lighting: Even across sweep

### Dolly (Camera moves)
- Any lens
- f/2.8-5.6 for separation
- Lighting: Practical lights visible OK

### Crane/Jib (3D movement)
- Wide to normal (14-50mm)
- f/5.6-11 for deep DOF
- Lighting: Big sources, minimal shadows

### Handheld (Energetic)
- Wide to normal (14-35mm)
- f/4-8 (forgiving focus)
- Lighting: Available light feel

### Steadicam (Smooth float)
- Normal (35-50mm)
- f/2.8-4
- Lighting: Motivated sources

## The "One Command" API

```python
# Professional DP approach - everything in one call
from lib.cinematic import setup_complete_shot

setup_complete_shot(
    shot_size="mcu",           # Medium close-up
    mood="dramatic",           # Determines lighting
    subject="my_product",      # What to frame
    style="apple_hero",        # Overall aesthetic
)

# This automatically:
# 1. Chooses lens (85mm for MCU)
# 2. Sets f-stop (f/4 for separation)
# 3. Positions camera (3/4 angle, eye height)
# 4. Creates lighting (gradient lighting for product)
# 5. Sets up backdrop (clean gradient)
# 6. Configures color grade (neutral, medium contrast)
```
