# Phase 11.0: Production Tracking Dashboard

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2026-02-19
**Requirements**: REQ-TRACK-01, REQ-TRACK-03

## Goal

Build a simple TypeScript UI to VIEW all production elements with status, blockers, and source traceability.

## Implementation

### Location: `tracking-ui/`

### Key Features Delivered

- [x] Kanban board with status columns (complete/in_progress/planned/vague/blocked)
- [x] Item cards with category, name, description, images
- [x] Filter by status and category
- [x] Search by name/id
- [x] Blocker panel always visible
- [x] Link to source spec for each item
- [x] All data in YAML files (no database)
- [x] Read-only by design - AI handles writes

```

### Tech Stack

- TypeScript + Vite
- YAML files for data
- No framework, minimal CSS
- No backend server

### Write Model

The UI is read-only. To add/edit items, talk to Claude:
> "Add a new character CHAR-003 named 'Villain' with status planned"
> "Mark WARD-015 as complete"
> "Add blocker to PROP-003: waiting on concept approval"

The AI edits the YAML files directly. No backend needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Kanban board displays items by status
- [x] Filters work for status and category
- [x] Search works by name/id
- [x] Blocker panel shows all blocked items
- [x] Items link to source specs
- [x] No backend required (YAML-based)

## Notes

Philosophy: If we need fancy UI tools, we're doing it wrong. Keep it simple, uniform, fluid.
