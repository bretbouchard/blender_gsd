# Phase 08.0 Plan 01: Follow Camera Foundation Summary

**Intelligent follow camera module structure with 8 follow modes, core types, collision detection, motion prediction, and 18 YAML presets for game-style camera following**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-19T19:31:03Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-19T19:33:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (all pre-existing, state directories created)
- **Files modified:** 2 (state directory .gitkeep files)

## Accomplishments

- Verified follow camera module structure already complete (10 Python modules)
- Verified core types with 8 FollowMode values and full serialization support
- Created state directories for pre-solved camera paths and preview videos
- Verified 18 follow mode presets in YAML configuration

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Follow Camera Module Structure** - `5d076f1` (feat)
   - Module structure and configuration files already existed from prior work
   - Created state directories with .gitkeep files

**Note:** Tasks 2 and 3 (types and configuration) were already complete - types.py has 473 lines with full implementations, follow_modes.yaml has 18 presets.

## Files Created/Modified

- `.gsd-state/follow_cam/solves/.gitkeep` - Pre-solved camera paths directory
- `.gsd-state/follow_cam/previews/.gitkeep` - Preview videos directory

### Pre-existing Files (verified)

- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/__init__.py` - Package initialization with 60 exports
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/types.py` - Core types (473 lines)
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/follow_modes.py` - Mode implementations
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/transitions.py` - Mode transitions
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/collision.py` - Collision detection
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/prediction.py` - Motion prediction
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/framing.py` - Intelligent framing
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/pre_solve.py` - Pre-solve workflow
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/navmesh.py` - Navigation mesh
- `lib/cinematic/follow_cam/debug.py` - Debug visualization
- `configs/cinematic/follow_cam/follow_modes.yaml` - 18 mode presets

## Decisions Made

- **State directory creation:** Module structure was complete from prior work, only state directories needed creation
- **.gitkeep pattern:** Used existing project pattern for tracking empty directories in git

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as specified. All tasks were already complete from prior work; only state directories required creation.

## Issues Encountered

None - verification passed immediately.

## Verification Results

```
Module structure:
  - 10 Python files in lib/cinematic/follow_cam/
  - All stub files have full implementations (not stubs)

Types verification:
  - FollowMode enum: 8 modes
  - FollowCameraConfig: serialization to_dict/from_dict works
  - CameraState: complete runtime state tracking

Configuration:
  - 18 follow_mode entries in follow_modes.yaml
  - Presets for all 8 follow modes plus collision and transition variants
```

## Next Phase Readiness

- Module structure complete and verified
- State directories created
- Ready for Phase 08.1 (Follow Mode Implementations) - which appears to also be complete based on existing module files
- All core types available with full serialization support
