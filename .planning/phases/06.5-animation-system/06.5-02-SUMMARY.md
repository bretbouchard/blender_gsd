# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Direct API keyframe insertion (obj.keyframe_insert, not bpy.ops)
    - LINEAR interpolation for constant-speed motion
    - BLENDER_AVAILABLE guards for import safety

key-files:
  created:
    - lib/cinematic/animation.py
    - lib/cinematic/motion_path.py
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "LINEAR interpolation for constant-speed turntable/orbit motion"
  - "Direct keyframe_insert API to avoid context dependencies"
  - "Separate motion_path module for procedural path generation"

patterns-established:
  - "Guarded Blender imports with BLENDER_AVAILABLE flag"
  - "Easing functions as pure math (no Blender dependencies)"
  - "Config-based animation creation via from_config functions"

# Phase 6.5 Plan 02: Animation Module Summary

**Camera animation system with 8 animation types, 18 easing functions, and procedural motion path generation for cinematic camera moves**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-19T04:02:50Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-19T04:18:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2 (animation.py, motion_path.py)

## Accomplishments
- Complete camera animation library with orbit, dolly, truck, crane, pan, tilt, rack_focus, push_in
- Turntable rotation system for product showcase with LINEAR interpolation
- 18 easing functions covering standard, quadratic, cubic, exponential, elastic, bounce, and back curves
- Procedural motion path generation with Bezier, arc, orbit, and Catmull-Rom spline support
- Follow Path constraint setup for complex camera movements

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create animation.py Module** - `8548c6b` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create motion_path.py Module** - `8548c6b` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `lib/cinematic/animation.py` (1203 lines) - Camera animation functions, easing library, turntable system
- `lib/cinematic/motion_path.py` (692 lines) - Procedural path generation, Follow Path setup

## Key Exports

**animation.py:**
- `create_orbit_animation()` - Circular camera motion around target
- `create_dolly_animation()` - Forward/backward camera movement
- `create_truck_animation()` - Lateral camera movement
- `create_crane_animation()` - Vertical + forward combination
- `create_pan_animation()` - Horizontal rotation
- `create_tilt_animation()` - Vertical rotation
- `create_rack_focus_animation()` - DoF focus distance animation
- `create_push_in_animation()` - Dolly zoom / vertigo effect
- `create_turntable_animation()` - Subject rotation for products
- `apply_camera_move_preset()` - Apply preset from camera_moves.yaml
- `apply_easing()` - 18 easing functions

**motion_path.py:**
- `generate_bezier_path()` - Cubic Bezier curve points
- `generate_arc_path()` - Arc around center point
- `generate_orbit_path()` - Orbit path with look-at rotation
- `interpolate_catmull_rom()` - Spline through waypoints
- `create_motion_path_curve()` - Blender curve object creation
- `setup_camera_follow_path()` - Follow Path constraint setup
- `calculate_path_length()` - Total path distance
- `get_point_at_distance()` - Interpolated point lookup
- `sample_path_uniformly()` - Uniform point distribution

## Decisions Made
- LINEAR interpolation for turntable/orbit to ensure constant speed (no ease_in_out which causes acceleration)
- Direct API calls (obj.keyframe_insert) instead of bpy.ops for context-free execution
- Separate motion_path module keeps path generation logic isolated
- Easing functions implemented as pure math for Blender independence

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. The modules already existed with complete implementations.

## Issues Encountered
None - modules were already implemented with all required functionality.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Animation system complete, ready for package exports
- Need to update __init__.py with animation and motion_path exports
- Ready for integration with shot_builder.py for complex shot sequences
