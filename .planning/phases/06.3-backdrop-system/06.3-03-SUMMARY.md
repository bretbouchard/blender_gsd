# Phase 6.3 Plan 03: Package Exports Summary

**Exported all 15 backdrop functions and preset loaders to lib.cinematic package, version bumped to 0.1.3**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-19T00:38:42Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-19T00:40:15Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Added 9 backdrop functions to package exports (create_infinite_curve, create_gradient_material, apply_gradient_material, setup_shadow_catcher, configure_render_for_shadow_catcher, create_backdrop, create_backdrop_from_preset, delete_backdrop, get_backdrop)
- Added 6 backdrop preset loaders to package exports (get_infinite_curve_preset, get_gradient_preset, get_environment_preset, list_infinite_curve_presets, list_gradient_presets, list_environment_presets)
- Updated module docstring to include backdrops module
- Bumped version from 0.1.2 to 0.1.3

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add backdrop exports to __init__.py** - `0ccc425` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Bump version to 0.1.3** - `0ccc425` (feat - combined with Task 1)

## Files Created/Modified

- `lib/cinematic/__init__.py` - Added backdrop imports, preset loader imports, __all__ entries, updated docstring, version bump

## Decisions Made

- Combined both tasks into single commit since they are logically related (exports and version bump for the same feature)
- Added backdrops to module docstring for documentation completeness

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - standard package export update.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Backdrop system complete with all 111 exports from lib.cinematic
- Version 0.1.3 marks Phase 6.3 completion
- Ready for Phase 6.4 (Animation System) or integration testing

## Version History

| Version | Phase | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 0.1.0 | 06-00 | Foundation |
| 0.1.1 | 06.1 | Camera System |
| 0.1.2 | 06.2 | Lighting System |
| 0.1.3 | 06.3 | Backdrop System (current) |
