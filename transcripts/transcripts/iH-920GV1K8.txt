[music] [music] [music] Hello, welcome my friends. Today I will Hello, welcome my friends. Today I will Hello, welcome my friends. Today I will show you a tutorial about cur nodes in show you a tutorial about cur nodes in show you a tutorial about cur nodes in geome geometry nodes. Uh it's a small geome geometry nodes. Uh it's a small geome geometry nodes. Uh it's a small node in the volume part of geometry node in the volume part of geometry node in the volume part of geometry nodes but but it's very interesting. So nodes but but it's very interesting. So nodes but but it's very interesting. So today I will show you how to use it to today I will show you how to use it to today I will show you how to use it to make uh this abstract particle effects. make uh this abstract particle effects. make uh this abstract particle effects. Uh so before we start this tutorial you Uh so before we start this tutorial you Uh so before we start this tutorial you can see I use CH GPT to uh show you what can see I use CH GPT to uh show you what can see I use CH GPT to uh show you what is curl. Uh it's an interesting effect is curl. Uh it's an interesting effect is curl. Uh it's an interesting effect and it will create uh swirling and and it will create uh swirling and and it will create uh swirling and turbulence motion. Uh it can be based on turbulence motion. Uh it can be based on turbulence motion. Uh it can be based on velocity. Uh it also can be based on velocity. Uh it also can be based on velocity. Uh it also can be based on other attribute. You just input one other attribute. You just input one other attribute. You just input one attribute and you will get get a cur attribute and you will get get a cur attribute and you will get get a cur effect. So you can see here uh this is effect. So you can see here uh this is effect. So you can see here uh this is what I did. Uh like I made a very simple what I did. Uh like I made a very simple what I did. Uh like I made a very simple uh VDB simulation and based on that uh VDB simulation and based on that uh VDB simulation and based on that simulation I distribute points here and simulation I distribute points here and simulation I distribute points here and make it move and you can see the make it move and you can see the make it move and you can see the geometry system here. It's very simple. geometry system here. It's very simple. geometry system here. It's very simple. Uh so let's begin our tutorial today. So Uh so let's begin our tutorial today. So Uh so let's begin our tutorial today. So let's go to uh blend 5.0 zero and uh we let's go to uh blend 5.0 zero and uh we let's go to uh blend 5.0 zero and uh we want we need a cube and this cube is want we need a cube and this cube is want we need a cube and this cube is good. good. good. So we need to just go to geometry nodes So we need to just go to geometry nodes So we need to just go to geometry nodes here and press new. Before we do that, we and press new. Before we do that, we and press new. Before we do that, we need a uh we need a VDB uh simulation. need a uh we need a VDB uh simulation. need a uh we need a VDB uh simulation. So we need to import that and and I So we need to import that and and I So we need to import that and and I prepared one prepared one prepared one already. Let's let's let's just find it already. Let's let's let's just find it already. Let's let's let's just find it here. here. Ensure to choose uh ensure to add here. Ensure to choose uh ensure to add here. Ensure to choose uh ensure to add all the VDB files here and you will get all the VDB files here and you will get all the VDB files here and you will get this. And if we press play, it's like this. And if we press play, it's like this. And if we press play, it's like this. It's just the basic animation. this. It's just the basic animation. this. It's just the basic animation. Very simple. So let's go back to uh the Very simple. So let's go back to uh the Very simple. So let's go back to uh the cube and change the name to particle cube and change the name to particle cube and change the name to particle and uh and uh and uh the VDB reference and remember to save it uh first. So, so and remember to save it uh first. So, so and remember to save it uh first. So, so here, so first I need to so first I need to so first I need to transform the geometry transform the geometry transform the geometry uh to the same place as the VDB uh to the same place as the VDB uh to the same place as the VDB simulation through here. Then I will drag the VDB reference Then I will drag the VDB reference Then I will drag the VDB reference inside here. inside here. inside here. So first we need to create the particle So first we need to create the particle So first we need to create the particle system. system. system. So I will distribute points uh I will I So I will distribute points uh I will I So I will distribute points uh I will I want the points inside the geometry. So want the points inside the geometry. So want the points inside the geometry. So I will distribute points inside the I will distribute points inside the I will distribute points inside the volume but it's not a volume. So I need volume but it's not a volume. So I need volume but it's not a volume. So I need to change the mesh to volume. to change the mesh to volume. to change the mesh to volume. So we we have this So we we have this So we we have this and I don't want the random effect. I and I don't want the random effect. I and I don't want the random effect. I want a grid. So but for you you can use want a grid. So but for you you can use want a grid. So but for you you can use the random. So use everything anything the random. So use everything anything the random. So use everything anything you want. So 0.3 and I think 0.1 you want. So 0.3 and I think 0.1 you want. So 0.3 and I think 0.1 just for test and uh set point radius and uh set point radius and uh set point radius to make to make to make to make it more clear to see 0.1 yeah then yeah I can't see anything yeah then yeah I can't see anything yeah then yeah I can't see anything inside inside inside but I think I I think it's okay. So, we but I think I I think it's okay. So, we but I think I I think it's okay. So, we have the particles. Then I need to build have the particles. Then I need to build have the particles. Then I need to build a sim uh build the simulation system. So, as usual, we add a simulation nodes So, as usual, we add a simulation nodes So, as usual, we add a simulation nodes here. And as usual, we need a set here. And as usual, we need a set here. And as usual, we need a set position here. position here. position here. So, we will make it move. So, we will make it move. So, we will make it move. Now, I think it's a little bit too much Now, I think it's a little bit too much Now, I think it's a little bit too much points for now. And now, I think I will points for now. And now, I think I will points for now. And now, I think I will create a vector. Yeah. Then you can you can see the Yeah. Then you can you can see the Yeah. Then you can you can see the volume inside the VDB inside is Yeah. volume inside the VDB inside is Yeah. volume inside the VDB inside is Yeah. It's changing. It's changing. It's changing. So this is the particle system. So this is the particle system. So this is the particle system. It's a it's so simple. This is the It's a it's so simple. This is the It's a it's so simple. This is the particle system. particle system. particle system. Okay. We have the particle system. Then Okay. We have the particle system. Then Okay. We have the particle system. Then we want to make it move. So we need a a we want to make it move. So we need a a we want to make it move. So we need a a force. We will get the force from the force. We will get the force from the force. We will get the force from the VDB. So here uh we can see the VDB here. VDB. So here uh we can see the VDB here. VDB. So here uh we can see the VDB here. And remember to turn to relative. And remember to turn to relative. And remember to turn to relative. And first we need to get the attribute And first we need to get the attribute And first we need to get the attribute from the VDB. from the VDB. from the VDB. So we will use this one. So we will use this one. So we will use this one. We will get the velocity. We will get the velocity. We will get the velocity. So you can see it has a velocity but So you can see it has a velocity but So you can see it has a velocity but it's not float we change it to vector. it's not float we change it to vector. it's not float we change it to vector. So after we get the uh vector uh get So after we get the uh vector uh get So after we get the uh vector uh get attribute uh before we use that in attribute uh before we use that in attribute uh before we use that in blender uh the attribute is like a blender uh the attribute is like a blender uh the attribute is like a compressed. So we need to to compressed. So we need to to compressed. So we need to to uncompressed it. So we need a volume uh uncompressed it. So we need a volume uh uncompressed it. So we need a volume uh we need a node called workized grid. we need a node called workized grid. we need a node called workized grid. So we also change it to react connect So we also change it to react connect So we also change it to react connect here and after that uh we want we we just and after that uh we want we we just and after that uh we want we we just can't uh use it directly. can't uh use it directly. can't uh use it directly. So So So uh so this attribute is still for the uh so this attribute is still for the uh so this attribute is still for the VDB we can't use it in mesh like points VDB we can't use it in mesh like points VDB we can't use it in mesh like points edges and faces. So, so we need a edges and faces. So, so we need a edges and faces. So, so we need a translator node and then it's got it's translator node and then it's got it's translator node and then it's got it's called a sample sample grade. So, it called a sample sample grade. So, it called a sample sample grade. So, it will turn the turn the volume attribute will turn the turn the volume attribute will turn the turn the volume attribute into match attribute. Then, so that's the basic structure. So, Then, so that's the basic structure. So, Then, so that's the basic structure. So, here here here uh here is a uh velocity attribute. So, uh here is a uh velocity attribute. So, uh here is a uh velocity attribute. So, we will add a curl here. So here we will turn the velocity into So here we will turn the velocity into So here we will turn the velocity into curl into like into a turbulent effect. into a turbulent effect. into a turbulent effect. Then we connect uh this attribute Then we connect uh this attribute Then we connect uh this attribute to the particle system here. to the particle system here. to the particle system here. So before we press play and we need to So before we press play and we need to So before we press play and we need to tweak this uh uh to tweak this force tweak this uh uh to tweak this force tweak this uh uh to tweak this force just make it like usable. Uh we need to have normalize where Uh we need to have normalize where Uh we need to have normalize where normalize. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we need a a scale And we need a a scale And we need a a scale here. here. here. Maybe change it to 0.1 Maybe change it to 0.1 Maybe change it to 0.1 to make it safe. to make it safe. to make it safe. And yeah, And yeah, And yeah, so this is relay it. This is the force. relay it. This is the force. relay it. This is the force. So let's first first try try it. Press So let's first first try try it. Press So let's first first try try it. Press playing. uh you will see some points uh yeah the uh you will see some points uh yeah the uh you will see some points uh yeah the points is moving inside points is moving inside points is moving inside so that's very good so it means our so that's very good so it means our so that's very good so it means our system is is good is right system is is good is right system is is good is right so we don't want next part we don't want so we don't want next part we don't want so we don't want next part we don't want the outside of the outside of the outside of uh outside points we just want the uh outside points we just want the uh outside points we just want the points uh can move. So points uh can move. So points uh can move. So here there is a here there is a here there is a is a very important step to store an is a very important step to store an is a very important step to store an attri named the attribute and connect it attri named the attribute and connect it attri named the attribute and connect it from here. We will store the velocity from here. We will store the velocity from here. We will store the velocity attribute. We will copy the velocity here. We store it velocity here. We store it velocity here. We store it velocity uh and store it as a vector and then we uh and store it as a vector and then we uh and store it as a vector and then we will use a delete attribute. We just will use a delete attribute. We just will use a delete attribute. We just want to delete outside. The outside want to delete outside. The outside want to delete outside. The outside points doesn't have any velocity. Uh so we will have name attribute here Uh so we will have name attribute here Uh so we will have name attribute here and we will have velocity and compare in this step. I think I use float. I in this step. I think I use float. I in this step. I think I use float. I will turn the vector into float and yeah will turn the vector into float and yeah will turn the vector into float and yeah if it's uh less than or equal zero it if it's uh less than or equal zero it if it's uh less than or equal zero it will be deleted. will be deleted. will be deleted. So let's press play. So let's press play. So let's press play. So you will only have these points. So that's very good. And let's try have So that's very good. And let's try have So that's very good. And let's try have more points. So this system is almost more points. So this system is almost more points. So this system is almost ready. Let's have more points here. Let's have more points here. Let's have more points here. And to make it more clear, no too much. And let's hide the reference. VB And let's hide the reference. VB And let's hide the reference. VB reference. reference. reference. Drag it here. So it will have the points. So it will have the points. So it will have the points. If we see it from here, you see that If we see it from here, you see that If we see it from here, you see that curve curve curve is pretty beautiful. So if you make that you can have more So if you make that you can have more So if you make that you can have more points and you make a uh like a much points and you make a uh like a much points and you make a uh like a much better simulation. uh like my VDB reference is just a a uh like my VDB reference is just a a uh like my VDB reference is just a a very simple simulation. You can have a very simple simulation. You can have a very simple simulation. You can have a better one. better one. better one. And before I end this tutorial, there's And before I end this tutorial, there's And before I end this tutorial, there's uh two important uh uh two important uh two important uh uh two important uh two important uh uh two important parts here. Firstly, the material. So if parts here. Firstly, the material. So if parts here. Firstly, the material. So if you want to render like make it make you want to render like make it make you want to render like make it make this particle colorful, you can use uh this particle colorful, you can use uh this particle colorful, you can use uh the velocity here. You set uh the the velocity here. You set uh the the velocity here. You set uh the material here and go to shading. material here and go to shading. material here and go to shading. You can have attribute here. So you can You can have attribute here. So you can You can have attribute here. So you can put a velocity here and then you can put a velocity here and then you can put a velocity here and then you can ramp the ramp the ramp the ramp the velocity. ramp the velocity. ramp the velocity. Then click to base color or anything. So Then click to base color or anything. So Then click to base color or anything. So you you will have a colorful effect. And uh then another part is And uh then another part is And uh then another part is the motion blur. So if you make particle the motion blur. So if you make particle the motion blur. So if you make particle system in geometry nodes, you will have system in geometry nodes, you will have system in geometry nodes, you will have no motion blur. So if you want that no motion blur. So if you want that no motion blur. So if you want that motion blur, so I already did this for motion blur, so I already did this for motion blur, so I already did this for you. I stored the velocity. So you you. I stored the velocity. So you you. I stored the velocity. So you already have the velocity and this already have the velocity and this already have the velocity and this velocity is um much better than the like velocity is um much better than the like velocity is um much better than the like basic one inside Blender. You can tweak basic one inside Blender. You can tweak basic one inside Blender. You can tweak this velocity this velocity this velocity scale. scale. scale. So you can make it huge, big, huge, big. So you can make it huge, big, huge, big. So you can make it huge, big, huge, big. You can make it uh very small and you You can make it uh very small and you You can make it uh very small and you can make it into other direction. can make it into other direction. can make it into other direction. Anything you want. So you what you need Anything you want. So you what you need Anything you want. So you what you need to do is just uh turn on motion blur. Uh to do is just uh turn on motion blur. Uh to do is just uh turn on motion blur. Uh I think this yeah here turn on motion I think this yeah here turn on motion I think this yeah here turn on motion balloon and uh took a little part here balloon and uh took a little part here balloon and uh took a little part here and the most important you can scale it and the most important you can scale it and the most important you can scale it here you can have a super motion blur uh here you can have a super motion blur uh here you can have a super motion blur uh in the particle system. in the particle system. in the particle system.
