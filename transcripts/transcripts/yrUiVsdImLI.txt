In this tutorial, we're going to make In this tutorial, we're going to make In this tutorial, we're going to make realistic fur. And I'm not talking about realistic fur. And I'm not talking about realistic fur. And I'm not talking about that hair particle system nonsense. that hair particle system nonsense. that hair particle system nonsense. Here's the algorithm. I'm going to start Here's the algorithm. I'm going to start Here's the algorithm. I'm going to start off with a spiral that I'm going to off with a spiral that I'm going to off with a spiral that I'm going to shape, create some duplicates with some shape, create some duplicates with some shape, create some duplicates with some variation, maybe make a few copies of variation, maybe make a few copies of variation, maybe make a few copies of these that are, you know, slightly these that are, you know, slightly these that are, you know, slightly different from each other on our object. different from each other on our object. different from each other on our object. I'm going to distribute a bunch of I'm going to distribute a bunch of I'm going to distribute a bunch of points. And then I'm going to instance points. And then I'm going to instance points. And then I'm going to instance our thing on that. Make it look good our thing on that. Make it look good our thing on that. Make it look good with a material. That's it. So, let me with a material. That's it. So, let me with a material. That's it. So, let me show you how to do that. And this video show you how to do that. And this video show you how to do that. And this video is sponsored by Squarespace, and we'll is sponsored by Squarespace, and we'll is sponsored by Squarespace, and we'll talk about that later. In geometry talk about that later. In geometry talk about that later. In geometry nodes, we're going to start off with a nodes, we're going to start off with a nodes, we're going to start off with a spiral using a spiral node. This spiral spiral using a spiral node. This spiral spiral using a spiral node. This spiral should look more like this. Kind of like should look more like this. Kind of like should look more like this. Kind of like a unclosed circle. I'm going to bring a unclosed circle. I'm going to bring a unclosed circle. I'm going to bring down the height. Bring down the rotation down the height. Bring down the rotation down the height. Bring down the rotation until it's roughly what I want. From the until it's roughly what I want. From the until it's roughly what I want. From the top view, it should be pinching as it top view, it should be pinching as it top view, it should be pinching as it grows out. So, bring down the end radius grows out. So, bring down the end radius grows out. So, bring down the end radius until it looks something like that. I until it looks something like that. I until it looks something like that. I want there to be like instances that are want there to be like instances that are want there to be like instances that are slightly varied. Some of them are short, slightly varied. Some of them are short, slightly varied. Some of them are short, some of them are long, and it's going to some of them are long, and it's going to some of them are long, and it's going to be distorted. To do this, I'm going to be distorted. To do this, I'm going to be distorted. To do this, I'm going to make some variations. So, I'm going to make some variations. So, I'm going to make some variations. So, I'm going to have points. Let's say I have 10 of have points. Let's say I have 10 of have points. Let's say I have 10 of these. And then for each of these 10 these. And then for each of these 10 these. And then for each of these 10 points, not instances, for each, points, not instances, for each, points, not instances, for each, separate out the point. Inside of here separate out the point. Inside of here separate out the point. Inside of here is where we're going to put our spiral is where we're going to put our spiral is where we're going to put our spiral so that we can kind of give this so that we can kind of give this so that we can kind of give this different settings. So you can see here different settings. So you can see here different settings. So you can see here we have 10 splines or we could have 15 we have 10 splines or we could have 15 we have 10 splines or we could have 15 or you know whatever it is. Each one or you know whatever it is. Each one or you know whatever it is. Each one needs to be slightly offseted and we can needs to be slightly offseted and we can needs to be slightly offseted and we can treat that by like picking a different treat that by like picking a different treat that by like picking a different start and end radius. For each of these start and end radius. For each of these start and end radius. For each of these I'm going to pick a random value. In I'm going to pick a random value. In I'm going to pick a random value. In fact, I'm going to pick a single random fact, I'm going to pick a single random fact, I'm going to pick a single random value. This node right here that doesn't value. This node right here that doesn't value. This node right here that doesn't come in default blender you can get for come in default blender you can get for come in default blender you can get for free from my node pack. So literally free from my node pack. So literally free from my node pack. So literally cggatter.com go to free nodes and you cggatter.com go to free nodes and you cggatter.com go to free nodes and you can download an add-on that will let you can download an add-on that will let you can download an add-on that will let you refresh my node pack every time I update refresh my node pack every time I update refresh my node pack every time I update it. That will just give you free nodes. it. That will just give you free nodes. it. That will just give you free nodes. Lets me make the videos faster. This Lets me make the videos faster. This Lets me make the videos faster. This single random value is going to be single random value is going to be single random value is going to be dependent on the current index. So for dependent on the current index. So for dependent on the current index. So for each of the 10 of these, we're going to each of the 10 of these, we're going to each of the 10 of these, we're going to have a random number like 0.12 whatever have a random number like 0.12 whatever have a random number like 0.12 whatever it may be. This I want to connect to the it may be. This I want to connect to the it may be. This I want to connect to the start radius. And all of the sudden we start radius. And all of the sudden we start radius. And all of the sudden we have these variations. Since the default have these variations. Since the default have these variations. Since the default value is roughly one, let's vary this value is roughly one, let's vary this value is roughly one, let's vary this from like.5 to 1.5. And to vary kind of from like.5 to 1.5. And to vary kind of from like.5 to 1.5. And to vary kind of the curvature of this cuz they're the curvature of this cuz they're the curvature of this cuz they're perfectly aligned. We need some of them perfectly aligned. We need some of them perfectly aligned. We need some of them to coil more than others. And this is to coil more than others. And this is to coil more than others. And this is great cuz I can again use a single great cuz I can again use a single great cuz I can again use a single random value. And rotations is hovering random value. And rotations is hovering random value. And rotations is hovering around like 8. So let's go from 0.5 to around like 8. So let's go from 0.5 to around like 8. So let's go from 0.5 to like 1.2 2. Connect that to rotations like 1.2 2. Connect that to rotations like 1.2 2. Connect that to rotations and now they're kind of different from and now they're kind of different from and now they're kind of different from each other. Additionally, the height, each other. Additionally, the height, each other. Additionally, the height, how far off the surface it goes, can how far off the surface it goes, can how far off the surface it goes, can also be randomized. So, just a bunch of also be randomized. So, just a bunch of also be randomized. So, just a bunch of random values 2 to 1. Connect that to random values 2 to 1. Connect that to random values 2 to 1. Connect that to the height. Another way we can randomize the height. Another way we can randomize the height. Another way we can randomize is this end radius. How much does it is this end radius. How much does it is this end radius. How much does it pinch at the end? And I do want it to pinch at the end? And I do want it to pinch at the end? And I do want it to pinch quite a bit. So, single random pinch quite a bit. So, single random pinch quite a bit. So, single random value connected to the end radius, which value connected to the end radius, which value connected to the end radius, which is around 6.3 to 7. Last of all, I'm is around 6.3 to 7. Last of all, I'm is around 6.3 to 7. Last of all, I'm going to trim the curve, which is going going to trim the curve, which is going going to trim the curve, which is going to let me, you know, do this. And this to let me, you know, do this. And this to let me, you know, do this. And this will let me make some hairs longer or will let me make some hairs longer or will let me make some hairs longer or shorter than others. random value with shorter than others. random value with shorter than others. random value with this index halfway.5 all the way to one. this index halfway.5 all the way to one. this index halfway.5 all the way to one. Connect that here. So essentially what Connect that here. So essentially what Connect that here. So essentially what we've done now is we've made like a we've done now is we've made like a we've done now is we've made like a custom curl generator basically. And as custom curl generator basically. And as custom curl generator basically. And as a final kind of hit of detail, we should a final kind of hit of detail, we should a final kind of hit of detail, we should probably distort this. Use the distort probably distort this. Use the distort probably distort this. Use the distort node again from cdgatter.com. That will node again from cdgatter.com. That will node again from cdgatter.com. That will give you this. I'm going to bring down give you this. I'm going to bring down give you this. I'm going to bring down the strength to like 10%. Bring down the the strength to like 10%. Bring down the the strength to like 10%. Bring down the scale so it's lower frequency detail. scale so it's lower frequency detail. scale so it's lower frequency detail. And you can see right now the noise is And you can see right now the noise is And you can see right now the noise is kind of continuous. They're bunching and kind of continuous. They're bunching and kind of continuous. They're bunching and doing this kind of together. I want them doing this kind of together. I want them doing this kind of together. I want them to behave more separately. I can do this to behave more separately. I can do this to behave more separately. I can do this by taking the coordinates of the by taking the coordinates of the by taking the coordinates of the distortion which basically tells you distortion which basically tells you distortion which basically tells you where should this like noise be mapped where should this like noise be mapped where should this like noise be mapped to. You can use this kind of like as a to. You can use this kind of like as a to. You can use this kind of like as a randomization seed. So why don't we take randomization seed. So why don't we take randomization seed. So why don't we take the index one more time connected here. the index one more time connected here. the index one more time connected here. Now they all act independently and you Now they all act independently and you Now they all act independently and you pick some numbers that feel right to pick some numbers that feel right to pick some numbers that feel right to you. And this can be considered one hair you. And this can be considered one hair you. And this can be considered one hair spiral. When we're done with it we'll do spiral. When we're done with it we'll do spiral. When we're done with it we'll do one final resampling to I don't know it one final resampling to I don't know it one final resampling to I don't know it shouldn't be too much. Maybe like 60 shouldn't be too much. Maybe like 60 shouldn't be too much. Maybe like 60 iterations. We can turn it into geometry iterations. We can turn it into geometry iterations. We can turn it into geometry cuz this is essentially a bunch of cuz this is essentially a bunch of cuz this is essentially a bunch of curves. Run a curve to mesh. And then curves. Run a curve to mesh. And then curves. Run a curve to mesh. And then what do we mesh it by? Maybe like a what do we mesh it by? Maybe like a what do we mesh it by? Maybe like a curved circle set to a low resolution curved circle set to a low resolution curved circle set to a low resolution like three. Bring down the scale to like three. Bring down the scale to like three. Bring down the scale to something where you can see the something where you can see the something where you can see the individual hair strands. And then let's individual hair strands. And then let's individual hair strands. And then let's just give it many many more iterations just give it many many more iterations just give it many many more iterations like 30. This is a single hair clump. like 30. This is a single hair clump. like 30. This is a single hair clump. I'm going to take all of this, turn it I'm going to take all of this, turn it I'm going to take all of this, turn it into a node group, maybe like literally into a node group, maybe like literally into a node group, maybe like literally everything. Ctrl G. And this can be everything. Ctrl G. And this can be everything. Ctrl G. And this can be considered our clump or whatever. Our considered our clump or whatever. Our considered our clump or whatever. Our clump should have some exposed clump should have some exposed clump should have some exposed parameters. I want to know how many parameters. I want to know how many parameters. I want to know how many points make up the clump. I probably points make up the clump. I probably points make up the clump. I probably want to have a control of the seed in want to have a control of the seed in want to have a control of the seed in general, which I can offset by just like general, which I can offset by just like general, which I can offset by just like adding a number like 1 2 3 whatever. So adding a number like 1 2 3 whatever. So adding a number like 1 2 3 whatever. So that should be a parameter. And then that should be a parameter. And then that should be a parameter. And then maybe we can make one more offset. Maybe maybe we can make one more offset. Maybe maybe we can make one more offset. Maybe something like the end radius, which something like the end radius, which something like the end radius, which ends up making it look quite different. ends up making it look quite different. ends up making it look quite different. So I'm going to add one more So I'm going to add one more So I'm going to add one more contribution. This is going to be our contribution. This is going to be our contribution. This is going to be our end radius. Maybe one more parameter we end radius. Maybe one more parameter we end radius. Maybe one more parameter we might want to control is the strength. might want to control is the strength. might want to control is the strength. Very easy to do. I'm just going to Very easy to do. I'm just going to Very easy to do. I'm just going to expose the strength vector. And there we expose the strength vector. And there we expose the strength vector. And there we go. This is our node group with go. This is our node group with go. This is our node group with parameters basically. So I could change parameters basically. So I could change parameters basically. So I could change the number of hairs. I can change the the number of hairs. I can change the the number of hairs. I can change the end radius. And now we have a way to end radius. And now we have a way to end radius. And now we have a way to make our clumps distinct. Speaking of make our clumps distinct. Speaking of make our clumps distinct. Speaking of which, let's make three different which, let's make three different which, let's make three different variations. Or you can make however many variations. Or you can make however many variations. Or you can make however many you want. The second one might pinch to you want. The second one might pinch to you want. The second one might pinch to a smaller number, have fewer hairs, a a smaller number, have fewer hairs, a a smaller number, have fewer hairs, a bit less distortion since it's more bit less distortion since it's more bit less distortion since it's more clumped together, and definitely a clumped together, and definitely a clumped together, and definitely a different seed. The final clump, different seed. The final clump, different seed. The final clump, different seed for sure, extra hairs, a different seed for sure, extra hairs, a different seed for sure, extra hairs, a little pinched, and then extra little pinched, and then extra little pinched, and then extra distortion maybe. So now we have three distortion maybe. So now we have three distortion maybe. So now we have three different clumps that all look different different clumps that all look different different clumps that all look different from each other. And when we instance from each other. And when we instance from each other. And when we instance them, you will not be able to see the them, you will not be able to see the them, you will not be able to see the pattern as much. I'm going to treat each pattern as much. I'm going to treat each pattern as much. I'm going to treat each of these as a instance, which will help of these as a instance, which will help of these as a instance, which will help with our instancing. Geometry to with our instancing. Geometry to with our instancing. Geometry to instance. I want each of these to be instance. I want each of these to be instance. I want each of these to be separate. And then I just join them separate. And then I just join them separate. And then I just join them together so that we have a collection in together so that we have a collection in together so that we have a collection in the sense of three instances. Right here the sense of three instances. Right here the sense of three instances. Right here we have three different instances with we have three different instances with we have three different instances with different parameters. Super simple to different parameters. Super simple to different parameters. Super simple to interpret. Then on my initial geometry, interpret. Then on my initial geometry, interpret. Then on my initial geometry, don't forget we have like a cube or don't forget we have like a cube or don't forget we have like a cube or whatever here. Let's in fact make it a whatever here. Let's in fact make it a whatever here. Let's in fact make it a very smooth sphere. I want to distribute very smooth sphere. I want to distribute very smooth sphere. I want to distribute a bunch of points on the faces. So we a bunch of points on the faces. So we a bunch of points on the faces. So we get something like this. Each one's get something like this. Each one's get something like this. Each one's going to represent a clump. We'll make going to represent a clump. We'll make going to represent a clump. We'll make this super dense. And then I'm going to this super dense. And then I'm going to this super dense. And then I'm going to instance on these points for each one instance on these points for each one instance on these points for each one one of these three variants. Plug this one of these three variants. Plug this one of these three variants. Plug this into the instance. And then make sure into the instance. And then make sure into the instance. And then make sure you have pick instance enabled. This you have pick instance enabled. This you have pick instance enabled. This will let you pick one of the three each will let you pick one of the three each will let you pick one of the three each time. Finally, we we need to take this time. Finally, we we need to take this time. Finally, we we need to take this nonsense over here and make it actually nonsense over here and make it actually nonsense over here and make it actually legible. One way to do that is you take legible. One way to do that is you take legible. One way to do that is you take the scale and bring it down until you the scale and bring it down until you the scale and bring it down until you can see the actual clumps. And you can can see the actual clumps. And you can can see the actual clumps. And you can see it's starting to look quite soft. see it's starting to look quite soft. see it's starting to look quite soft. This should be a randomized value so This should be a randomized value so This should be a randomized value so that it's not always the same size. that it's not always the same size. that it's not always the same size. Let's go from 03 to 008 and make that Let's go from 03 to 008 and make that Let's go from 03 to 008 and make that the scale. So now they're not all all the scale. So now they're not all all the scale. So now they're not all all the same size. And then finally to get the same size. And then finally to get the same size. And then finally to get them going off of the surface normal, so them going off of the surface normal, so them going off of the surface normal, so they're kind of pointing off of the skin they're kind of pointing off of the skin they're kind of pointing off of the skin and it's like fur. Take the rotation, and it's like fur. Take the rotation, and it's like fur. Take the rotation, make it the rotation. And just like make it the rotation. And just like make it the rotation. And just like that, we have furiness. Very good. Very that, we have furiness. Very good. Very that, we have furiness. Very good. Very good. bring up the density quite a lot. good. bring up the density quite a lot. good. bring up the density quite a lot. Don't be shy to make it like 300 or even Don't be shy to make it like 300 or even Don't be shy to make it like 300 or even a thousand. Let's join everything a thousand. Let's join everything a thousand. Let's join everything together. So, we have our initial together. So, we have our initial together. So, we have our initial surface plus all these instances that surface plus all these instances that surface plus all these instances that gets joined. And now we have a good gets joined. And now we have a good gets joined. And now we have a good basis to work off of. It's much more basis to work off of. It's much more basis to work off of. It's much more legible when it's shaded with cycles or legible when it's shaded with cycles or legible when it's shaded with cycles or whatever. Cycles GPU. I'm using Blender whatever. Cycles GPU. I'm using Blender whatever. Cycles GPU. I'm using Blender for or no, I'm using Blender 5.0. That's for or no, I'm using Blender 5.0. That's for or no, I'm using Blender 5.0. That's the important part, which has a very the important part, which has a very the important part, which has a very nice sky texture update with multiple nice sky texture update with multiple nice sky texture update with multiple scattering. Connect that there. Pick scattering. Connect that there. Pick scattering. Connect that there. Pick some settings that actually make this some settings that actually make this some settings that actually make this visible. And now you can kind of tell we visible. And now you can kind of tell we visible. And now you can kind of tell we have the basis for our fur. And it's not have the basis for our fur. And it's not have the basis for our fur. And it's not looking too bad, but we can make it look looking too bad, but we can make it look looking too bad, but we can make it look a whole lot better. This is the part a whole lot better. This is the part a whole lot better. This is the part where I tell you this video is sponsored where I tell you this video is sponsored where I tell you this video is sponsored by Squarespace. This is the service I by Squarespace. This is the service I by Squarespace. This is the service I used to make my website. You can go to used to make my website. You can go to used to make my website. You can go to cgmatter.com, go to free nodes, and get cgmatter.com, go to free nodes, and get cgmatter.com, go to free nodes, and get the nodes that I'm using. And because the nodes that I'm using. And because the nodes that I'm using. And because I'm using Squarespace to build and host I'm using Squarespace to build and host I'm using Squarespace to build and host this website, it comes with a lot of this website, it comes with a lot of this website, it comes with a lot of features. So here you can see my features. So here you can see my features. So here you can see my Squarespace UI. First of all, it comes Squarespace UI. First of all, it comes Squarespace UI. First of all, it comes with a content and membership section. with a content and membership section. with a content and membership section. So I literally sell my project files, So I literally sell my project files, So I literally sell my project files, including this one. That's possible including this one. That's possible including this one. That's possible because of Squarespace payments that let because of Squarespace payments that let because of Squarespace payments that let you pay directly without integrating you pay directly without integrating you pay directly without integrating something else. Second of all, you're something else. Second of all, you're something else. Second of all, you're going to see I have these assets over going to see I have these assets over going to see I have these assets over here, which I use throughout the here, which I use throughout the here, which I use throughout the website. get all kinds of gifts and website. get all kinds of gifts and website. get all kinds of gifts and stuff you might recognize from earlier stuff you might recognize from earlier stuff you might recognize from earlier posts. I like this cuz I can keep posts. I like this cuz I can keep posts. I like this cuz I can keep everything in one place. Finally, at everything in one place. Finally, at everything in one place. Finally, at this point, Squarespace has tightlyknit this point, Squarespace has tightlyknit this point, Squarespace has tightlyknit AI integration, which you can use to AI integration, which you can use to AI integration, which you can use to fill content, use for design, whatever. fill content, use for design, whatever. fill content, use for design, whatever. I can edit, add a section, add a block, I can edit, add a section, add a block, I can edit, add a section, add a block, like a text block or whatever you want like a text block or whatever you want like a text block or whatever you want it to be. And then in here, when I edit, it to be. And then in here, when I edit, it to be. And then in here, when I edit, you're going to see this little UI right you're going to see this little UI right you're going to see this little UI right here. And let's write a paragraph about here. And let's write a paragraph about here. And let's write a paragraph about what is new in Blender 5.0. Okay, it what is new in Blender 5.0. Okay, it what is new in Blender 5.0. Okay, it took a second to think and now it is took a second to think and now it is took a second to think and now it is filling all of our content, which you filling all of our content, which you filling all of our content, which you can then check, say, oh, I want to edit can then check, say, oh, I want to edit can then check, say, oh, I want to edit this part, whatever. So, if you're this part, whatever. So, if you're this part, whatever. So, if you're looking to build a website, try it out. looking to build a website, try it out. looking to build a website, try it out. And when you're ready to take your And when you're ready to take your And when you're ready to take your website and you want to launch it, make website and you want to launch it, make website and you want to launch it, make it live, you can use this link in the it live, you can use this link in the it live, you can use this link in the description to save 10% off your first description to save 10% off your first description to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or a domain. So, purchase of a website or a domain. So, purchase of a website or a domain. So, now we have this fur that our goal is to now we have this fur that our goal is to now we have this fur that our goal is to make it look better, but it's already make it look better, but it's already make it look better, but it's already part of the way there. I think a big part of the way there. I think a big part of the way there. I think a big step for this is taking this wool and step for this is taking this wool and step for this is taking this wool and particularly these like spirals that particularly these like spirals that particularly these like spirals that make up the instances and we need to make up the instances and we need to make up the instances and we need to randomize it where we can. So, for randomize it where we can. So, for randomize it where we can. So, for example, the rotation, I can add a example, the rotation, I can add a example, the rotation, I can add a random contribution. So, I'm going to random contribution. So, I'm going to random contribution. So, I'm going to rotate the rotation. It turns out one of rotate the rotation. It turns out one of rotate the rotation. It turns out one of the new nodes is random rotation or you the new nodes is random rotation or you the new nodes is random rotation or you can use my custom one, whichever one can use my custom one, whichever one can use my custom one, whichever one feels easier. I'm just going to use my feels easier. I'm just going to use my feels easier. I'm just going to use my own. Connect that right there. Bring own. Connect that right there. Bring own. Connect that right there. Bring down the strength until it's like 10% down the strength until it's like 10% down the strength until it's like 10% randomized. I believe you also want to randomized. I believe you also want to randomized. I believe you also want to make this in local space just so it make this in local space just so it make this in local space just so it rotates about the normal. And inside rotates about the normal. And inside rotates about the normal. And inside this node, which right now is packed, this node, which right now is packed, this node, which right now is packed, what I can do is I can unpack this uh by what I can do is I can unpack this uh by what I can do is I can unpack this uh by hitting that button I just hit. Go hitting that button I just hit. Go hitting that button I just hit. Go inside of here and instead of a random inside of here and instead of a random inside of here and instead of a random value that turns out to be a vector that value that turns out to be a vector that value that turns out to be a vector that I then scale by like a float, I'm just I then scale by like a float, I'm just I then scale by like a float, I'm just going to make a tiny modification. I'm going to make a tiny modification. I'm going to make a tiny modification. I'm going to make this multiply. So I can going to make this multiply. So I can going to make this multiply. So I can control XYZ and I can modify the control XYZ and I can modify the control XYZ and I can modify the strength to be a vector. Connect this strength to be a vector. Connect this strength to be a vector. Connect this back here. This is useful because is it back here. This is useful because is it back here. This is useful because is it the Z component? The Z component just the Z component? The Z component just the Z component? The Z component just rotates it about its own axis. And that rotates it about its own axis. And that rotates it about its own axis. And that can be as big as I want. It can be like can be as big as I want. It can be like can be as big as I want. It can be like 100. And then for the X and Y that kind 100. And then for the X and Y that kind 100. And then for the X and Y that kind of messes it up, but if it's subtle, of messes it up, but if it's subtle, of messes it up, but if it's subtle, it's good. I can pick some low numbers it's good. I can pick some low numbers it's good. I can pick some low numbers that do not mess it up. So before, that do not mess it up. So before, that do not mess it up. So before, after. Finally, I probably want some of after. Finally, I probably want some of after. Finally, I probably want some of these hair strands to kind of go taller these hair strands to kind of go taller these hair strands to kind of go taller than they were before. So for the random than they were before. So for the random than they were before. So for the random scale, I like 03 to 008, but I can make scale, I like 03 to 008, but I can make scale, I like 03 to 008, but I can make that a vector. that goes from 003 to that a vector. that goes from 003 to that a vector. that goes from 003 to 008. So it's exactly the same, but I can 008. So it's exactly the same, but I can 008. So it's exactly the same, but I can make the Z variation much bigger. So make the Z variation much bigger. So make the Z variation much bigger. So some of them get higher than the others, some of them get higher than the others, some of them get higher than the others, just subtly. And this will make it look just subtly. And this will make it look just subtly. And this will make it look more like it's being grown off of a more like it's being grown off of a more like it's being grown off of a surface. Consolidate nodes where you surface. Consolidate nodes where you surface. Consolidate nodes where you can, where you know you're not going to can, where you know you're not going to can, where you know you're not going to be editing anything. All of this looks be editing anything. All of this looks be editing anything. All of this looks great to me. And let's see what this great to me. And let's see what this great to me. And let's see what this looks like. Pretty good. And we haven't looks like. Pretty good. And we haven't looks like. Pretty good. And we haven't even done the shaders or anything yet. even done the shaders or anything yet. even done the shaders or anything yet. Before I do that, I'm just going to up Before I do that, I'm just going to up Before I do that, I'm just going to up the iteration so it better covers the the iteration so it better covers the the iteration so it better covers the surface. And it will render quite surface. And it will render quite surface. And it will render quite quickly. So not bad at all. And I quickly. So not bad at all. And I quickly. So not bad at all. And I probably want to add one more pass of probably want to add one more pass of probably want to add one more pass of detail so that it doesn't exactly look detail so that it doesn't exactly look detail so that it doesn't exactly look like instances everywhere. To do that, I like instances everywhere. To do that, I like instances everywhere. To do that, I need to take these instances and I'm need to take these instances and I'm need to take these instances and I'm going to realize them so that they're going to realize them so that they're going to realize them so that they're actual geometry. This is going to take a actual geometry. This is going to take a actual geometry. This is going to take a moment to compute. So what I would moment to compute. So what I would moment to compute. So what I would recommend is add a bake node which will recommend is add a bake node which will recommend is add a bake node which will let you do this calculation once and let you do this calculation once and let you do this calculation once and then save it. So let's bake on frame then save it. So let's bake on frame then save it. So let's bake on frame one. So now this is on disk or packed one. So now this is on disk or packed one. So now this is on disk or packed into your Blender file. Replace that into your Blender file. Replace that into your Blender file. Replace that connection over here so that it's using connection over here so that it's using connection over here so that it's using it. And then finally, I want to take it. And then finally, I want to take it. And then finally, I want to take this and apply like a distortion or this and apply like a distortion or this and apply like a distortion or whatever. So I'm going to use my distort whatever. So I'm going to use my distort whatever. So I'm going to use my distort node again. Make that bad boy way node again. Make that bad boy way node again. Make that bad boy way tinier. So maybe like a fifth of a tinier. So maybe like a fifth of a tinier. So maybe like a fifth of a percent or half a percent, I mean. And percent or half a percent, I mean. And percent or half a percent, I mean. And then I'm going to add a detail to that. then I'm going to add a detail to that. then I'm going to add a detail to that. So of course you can play with this So of course you can play with this So of course you can play with this more, but I think that's a pretty good more, but I think that's a pretty good more, but I think that's a pretty good start to get like soft looking wool. And start to get like soft looking wool. And start to get like soft looking wool. And if you want it to look more like hair, if you want it to look more like hair, if you want it to look more like hair, by the way, you can always go into this by the way, you can always go into this by the way, you can always go into this clumping. And when we turn it into a clumping. And when we turn it into a clumping. And when we turn it into a mesh, you can make those hairs thinner mesh, you can make those hairs thinner mesh, you can make those hairs thinner by just making the radius thinner, which by just making the radius thinner, which by just making the radius thinner, which of course if you do that will involve of course if you do that will involve of course if you do that will involve re-baking. Now the question is, what do re-baking. Now the question is, what do re-baking. Now the question is, what do we do for the shader to really make it we do for the shader to really make it we do for the shader to really make it look like hair and then make that look look like hair and then make that look look like hair and then make that look better? Well, all I need to do is add a better? Well, all I need to do is add a better? Well, all I need to do is add a set material node, which will allow me set material node, which will allow me set material node, which will allow me to pick a material. I'm going to make to pick a material. I'm going to make to pick a material. I'm going to make one called hair for example. This should one called hair for example. This should one called hair for example. This should be inheriting the hair material. The be inheriting the hair material. The be inheriting the hair material. The object itself can have a different object itself can have a different object itself can have a different material which I can call object. material which I can call object. material which I can call object. They're going to be very similar in They're going to be very similar in They're going to be very similar in color but using a different BSDF. So color but using a different BSDF. So color but using a different BSDF. So this one's going to be using the object. this one's going to be using the object. this one's going to be using the object. And now we are in shader land. First of And now we are in shader land. First of And now we are in shader land. First of all, I'm going to take my object and I'm all, I'm going to take my object and I'm all, I'm going to take my object and I'm going to make it more like a yellowish going to make it more like a yellowish going to make it more like a yellowish sheep skin. Something like that. That's sheep skin. Something like that. That's sheep skin. Something like that. That's going to be very rough because it's going to be very rough because it's going to be very rough because it's going to be the skin that's underneath going to be the skin that's underneath going to be the skin that's underneath all this stuff. It shouldn't be very all this stuff. It shouldn't be very all this stuff. It shouldn't be very reflective. And just so this is more reflective. And just so this is more reflective. And just so this is more visible, I'm going to get rid of the visible, I'm going to get rid of the visible, I'm going to get rid of the background which is looking nice. But background which is looking nice. But background which is looking nice. But there you go. And the difference here is there you go. And the difference here is there you go. And the difference here is instead of a principled BSDF, I'm going instead of a principled BSDF, I'm going instead of a principled BSDF, I'm going to use a principled hair. So even though to use a principled hair. So even though to use a principled hair. So even though this isn't a hair particle system, this isn't a hair particle system, this isn't a hair particle system, there's nothing stopping us from like there's nothing stopping us from like there's nothing stopping us from like using this. So principled hair. I would using this. So principled hair. I would using this. So principled hair. I would recommend using the melanin slider cuz recommend using the melanin slider cuz recommend using the melanin slider cuz that's more intuitive. So I'm going to that's more intuitive. So I'm going to that's more intuitive. So I'm going to get rid of all the redness. As you get rid of all the redness. As you get rid of all the redness. As you decrease the melanin, it's going to be decrease the melanin, it's going to be decrease the melanin, it's going to be like kind of like graying, whiter and like kind of like graying, whiter and like kind of like graying, whiter and whiter and whiter. So this is white whiter and whiter. So this is white whiter and whiter. So this is white hair. Somewhere around here should be hair. Somewhere around here should be hair. Somewhere around here should be blonde and then all the way to black. So blonde and then all the way to black. So blonde and then all the way to black. So just pick a color that you feel like just pick a color that you feel like just pick a color that you feel like represents the thing. Back in the represents the thing. Back in the represents the thing. Back in the object, now that we know what color this object, now that we know what color this object, now that we know what color this is, I guess we can edit it to be a bit is, I guess we can edit it to be a bit is, I guess we can edit it to be a bit more saturated to match. just so I can more saturated to match. just so I can more saturated to match. just so I can see the or rather not see the boundary a see the or rather not see the boundary a see the or rather not see the boundary a bit better. And that's pretty good. I bit better. And that's pretty good. I bit better. And that's pretty good. I mean, really all we need to do is like mean, really all we need to do is like mean, really all we need to do is like change the distribution if we want so change the distribution if we want so change the distribution if we want so that they're not uh they don't have bald that they're not uh they don't have bald that they're not uh they don't have bald spots. Although I think that actually spots. Although I think that actually spots. Although I think that actually adds quite a bit of something. Maybe in adds quite a bit of something. Maybe in adds quite a bit of something. Maybe in the roughness, which you can think of as the roughness, which you can think of as the roughness, which you can think of as how fibrous is this. Maybe uh take the how fibrous is this. Maybe uh take the how fibrous is this. Maybe uh take the roughness, bring it up so it kind of roughness, bring it up so it kind of roughness, bring it up so it kind of looks more like dirty hair that got wet looks more like dirty hair that got wet looks more like dirty hair that got wet at some point. Maybe also the same with at some point. Maybe also the same with at some point. Maybe also the same with the radial. I'll be honest, I don't know the radial. I'll be honest, I don't know the radial. I'll be honest, I don't know much about this BSDF, but that's much about this BSDF, but that's much about this BSDF, but that's definitely looking like kind of wet wool definitely looking like kind of wet wool definitely looking like kind of wet wool to me. Especially as you zoom in, you to me. Especially as you zoom in, you to me. Especially as you zoom in, you see it's composed of curls. And now we see it's composed of curls. And now we see it's composed of curls. And now we can control this quite nicely. And I can control this quite nicely. And I can control this quite nicely. And I should mention kind of the one that I should mention kind of the one that I should mention kind of the one that I was using I made in a live stream cuz was using I made in a live stream cuz was using I made in a live stream cuz I'm doing Nodevember every single day on I'm doing Nodevember every single day on I'm doing Nodevember every single day on the default Cube channel. So far, this the default Cube channel. So far, this the default Cube channel. So far, this is what I've made for the prompts. I'm is what I've made for the prompts. I'm is what I've made for the prompts. I'm going ham. It's taken two to four two to going ham. It's taken two to four two to going ham. It's taken two to four two to three hours every single day. I'm going three hours every single day. I'm going three hours every single day. I'm going to make the final kind of perfect blend to make the final kind of perfect blend to make the final kind of perfect blend file available on my website file available on my website file available on my website cgmatter.com. Again, if you want free cgmatter.com. Again, if you want free cgmatter.com. Again, if you want free nodes, go there. You don't need to be a nodes, go there. You don't need to be a nodes, go there. You don't need to be a member. But if you do want to be a member. But if you do want to be a member. But if you do want to be a member and get years worth of project member and get years worth of project member and get years worth of project files, then I would recommend joining. files, then I would recommend joining. files, then I would recommend joining. There's more every single day. There's There's more every single day. There's There's more every single day. There's 160 of you, close to 170. The only thing 160 of you, close to 170. The only thing 160 of you, close to 170. The only thing I would do beyond this that I did in the I would do beyond this that I did in the I would do beyond this that I did in the live stream so you can check it out is I live stream so you can check it out is I live stream so you can check it out is I distributed a bunch of points again and distributed a bunch of points again and distributed a bunch of points again and those represent where these clumps will those represent where these clumps will those represent where these clumps will kind of converge. This is the one I kind of converge. This is the one I kind of converge. This is the one I made. Very similar process except I made. Very similar process except I made. Very similar process except I didn't use instancing. I used the for didn't use instancing. I used the for didn't use instancing. I used the for each zone that I modified to look each zone that I modified to look each zone that I modified to look substantially softer and I did substantially softer and I did substantially softer and I did compositing. So you can check that out compositing. So you can check that out compositing. So you can check that out and hopefully you learned something. and hopefully you learned something. and hopefully you learned something. Goodbye. See you.
