in this blender tutorial I'm going to in this blender tutorial I'm going to in this blender tutorial I'm going to show you how to quickly set up an show you how to quickly set up an show you how to quickly set up an infinite background that has a curve so infinite background that has a curve so infinite background that has a curve so all the Shadows Fall Off very softly all the Shadows Fall Off very softly all the Shadows Fall Off very softly this is great for setting up Studio this is great for setting up Studio this is great for setting up Studio Lighting in blender and if you don't Lighting in blender and if you don't Lighting in blender and if you don't want to just have it on one side you can want to just have it on one side you can want to just have it on one side you can make it a corner shape so it's kind of make it a corner shape so it's kind of make it a corner shape so it's kind of like a photo swoop in a corner the first like a photo swoop in a corner the first like a photo swoop in a corner the first thing we want to do is go ahead and move thing we want to do is go ahead and move thing we want to do is go ahead and move our Cube up so I'm going to press G then our Cube up so I'm going to press G then our Cube up so I'm going to press G then Z then one and that just moves it up to Z then one and that just moves it up to Z then one and that just moves it up to the top then I can press shift a to make the top then I can press shift a to make the top then I can press shift a to make a new mesh and I'm going to make a plane a new mesh and I'm going to make a plane a new mesh and I'm going to make a plane I'll press s to scale and I'll scale I'll press s to scale and I'll scale I'll press s to scale and I'll scale this up this up this up it's not really important how big this it's not really important how big this it's not really important how big this is but I'm going to scale it just a is but I'm going to scale it just a is but I'm going to scale it just a little larger then we can press tab to little larger then we can press tab to little larger then we can press tab to go to edit mode I can select this vertex go to edit mode I can select this vertex go to edit mode I can select this vertex and if I right click I can click bevel and if I right click I can click bevel and if I right click I can click bevel vertices vertices vertices so now I can bevel the vertices you see so now I can bevel the vertices you see so now I can bevel the vertices you see how I'm pulling it in and when I click how I'm pulling it in and when I click how I'm pulling it in and when I click at about this range I can come down to at about this range I can come down to at about this range I can come down to the lower right to get the options then the lower right to get the options then the lower right to get the options then I can increase the segments so you want I can increase the segments so you want I can increase the segments so you want a good amount of segments so you know 10 a good amount of segments so you know 10 a good amount of segments so you know 10 segments is probably a good amount and segments is probably a good amount and segments is probably a good amount and then you can also vary the width if you then you can also vary the width if you then you can also vary the width if you weren't happy with your original weren't happy with your original weren't happy with your original decision so you want something kind of decision so you want something kind of decision so you want something kind of like this like this like this then you can go ahead and switch to Edge then you can go ahead and switch to Edge then you can go ahead and switch to Edge mode by pressing two and I can click mode by pressing two and I can click mode by pressing two and I can click here once hold Ctrl then click here once here once hold Ctrl then click here once here once hold Ctrl then click here once now I can press e and then Z to lock to now I can press e and then Z to lock to now I can press e and then Z to lock to the z-axis and go straight up the z-axis and go straight up the z-axis and go straight up now I'm still in Edge mode so once again now I'm still in Edge mode so once again now I'm still in Edge mode so once again I can click here hold Ctrl click here I can click here hold Ctrl click here I can click here hold Ctrl click here this is picking the shortest path so it this is picking the shortest path so it this is picking the shortest path so it selects these all automatically then I selects these all automatically then I selects these all automatically then I can right click or press Ctrl or command can right click or press Ctrl or command can right click or press Ctrl or command B and I can right click bevel edges and B and I can right click bevel edges and B and I can right click bevel edges and then it will start to Bevel those edges then it will start to Bevel those edges then it will start to Bevel those edges as I reach down as I reach down as I reach down and now I have a nice bevel here and of and now I have a nice bevel here and of and now I have a nice bevel here and of course you can change the number of course you can change the number of course you can change the number of segments that you want if you want it to segments that you want if you want it to segments that you want if you want it to be a bit smoother I'm going to go up to be a bit smoother I'm going to go up to be a bit smoother I'm going to go up to 15 and now I have this nice photo swoop 15 and now I have this nice photo swoop 15 and now I have this nice photo swoop that I can use for lighting and then if that I can use for lighting and then if that I can use for lighting and then if I tab back to object mode I can right I tab back to object mode I can right I tab back to object mode I can right click and shade smooth so it looks very click and shade smooth so it looks very click and shade smooth so it looks very smooth and I can also press s and I can smooth and I can also press s and I can smooth and I can also press s and I can scale this up and generally when you're scale this up and generally when you're scale this up and generally when you're shooting something with smooth lighting shooting something with smooth lighting shooting something with smooth lighting like this you want the object to be far like this you want the object to be far like this you want the object to be far away so I can press G then shift Z to away so I can press G then shift Z to away so I can press G then shift Z to lock to the X and Y axes and then now I lock to the X and Y axes and then now I lock to the X and Y axes and then now I have this light and everything set up so have this light and everything set up so have this light and everything set up so I can switch to the scene lighting and I can switch to the scene lighting and I can switch to the scene lighting and then I can move this light then I can move this light then I can move this light by pressing G then shift Z to move it by pressing G then shift Z to move it by pressing G then shift Z to move it over here and then I can press over here and then I can press over here and then I can press alt or option D to duplicate then press alt or option D to duplicate then press alt or option D to duplicate then press shift Z and I'll move this one right shift Z and I'll move this one right shift Z and I'll move this one right over here over here over here and so now you can see that I'm getting and so now you can see that I'm getting and so now you can see that I'm getting these nice soft Shadows now in Eevee you these nice soft Shadows now in Eevee you these nice soft Shadows now in Eevee you need to increase the the size and power need to increase the the size and power need to increase the the size and power of those lights a lot but if I was going of those lights a lot but if I was going of those lights a lot but if I was going to switch my renderer to Cycles here to switch my renderer to Cycles here to switch my renderer to Cycles here you'll notice that I'm getting that nice you'll notice that I'm getting that nice you'll notice that I'm getting that nice fall off alph into the distance and of fall off alph into the distance and of fall off alph into the distance and of course I can change the intensity of course I can change the intensity of course I can change the intensity of that light if I change that to something that light if I change that to something that light if I change that to something like 5000 like 5000 like 5000 then if I move the lights back by then if I move the lights back by then if I move the lights back by pressing G then shift Z I can move this pressing G then shift Z I can move this pressing G then shift Z I can move this light very far away and then I can do light very far away and then I can do light very far away and then I can do the same with this one and I can press G the same with this one and I can press G the same with this one and I can press G shift Z and move it away then I can shift Z and move it away then I can shift Z and move it away then I can shift-click both of them press G and z shift-click both of them press G and z shift-click both of them press G and z and move them up so as the lights get and move them up so as the lights get and move them up so as the lights get farther away farther away farther away all the shadows will become softer and all the shadows will become softer and all the shadows will become softer and nice and then if I nice and then if I nice and then if I tab into the view camera tab into the view camera tab into the view camera you can see that I have these nice you can see that I have these nice you can see that I have these nice shadows and then if I go ahead and look shadows and then if I go ahead and look shadows and then if I go ahead and look at View and I lock my camera to The View you can see here I can get a nice Studio you can see here I can get a nice Studio you can see here I can get a nice Studio render with a nice infinite background render with a nice infinite background render with a nice infinite background and I can keep moving those lights and I can keep moving those lights and I can keep moving those lights farther away and change the intensity to farther away and change the intensity to farther away and change the intensity to get the lighting setup I need get the lighting setup I need get the lighting setup I need let's see how that looks in Eevee so let's see how that looks in Eevee so let's see how that looks in Eevee so here in Eevee we also get that nice here in Eevee we also get that nice here in Eevee we also get that nice soft Shadow Fall Off and it's a really soft Shadow Fall Off and it's a really soft Shadow Fall Off and it's a really easy way to go ahead and make a studio easy way to go ahead and make a studio easy way to go ahead and make a studio lighting setup so this is how you do it lighting setup so this is how you do it lighting setup so this is how you do it with with with two walls you can also easily do this two walls you can also easily do this two walls you can also easily do this with a single plane so if I go shift a with a single plane so if I go shift a with a single plane so if I go shift a and I bring in another mesh plane and I bring in another mesh plane and I bring in another mesh plane and then I can press G and then shift Z and then I can press G and then shift Z and then I can press G and then shift Z to move this plane over here press s to to move this plane over here press s to to move this plane over here press s to scale scale scale then if I tab into edit mode and I still then if I tab into edit mode and I still then if I tab into edit mode and I still have Edge mode selected or press 2 then have Edge mode selected or press 2 then have Edge mode selected or press 2 then I can go ahead and just bevel this Edge I can go ahead and just bevel this Edge I can go ahead and just bevel this Edge right here after I extrude it so I can right here after I extrude it so I can right here after I extrude it so I can press e then Z extrude up and then I press e then Z extrude up and then I press e then Z extrude up and then I click this Edge right click bevel edges click this Edge right click bevel edges click this Edge right click bevel edges and then I can increase the width of and then I can increase the width of and then I can increase the width of that bevel so now I have a traditional that bevel so now I have a traditional that bevel so now I have a traditional single photo sweep so sometimes this is single photo sweep so sometimes this is single photo sweep so sometimes this is the proper setup with a single sweep the proper setup with a single sweep the proper setup with a single sweep like this and other times it's better to like this and other times it's better to like this and other times it's better to have that surround feeling so no matter have that surround feeling so no matter have that surround feeling so no matter what you're doing you can quickly make what you're doing you can quickly make what you're doing you can quickly make infinite smooth backgrounds in blender infinite smooth backgrounds in blender infinite smooth backgrounds in blender with just a few bevels and extrudes with just a few bevels and extrudes with just a few bevels and extrudes happy 3D modeling
