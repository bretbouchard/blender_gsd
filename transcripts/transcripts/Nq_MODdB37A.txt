Hello friends, welcome to my channel. Hello friends, welcome to my channel. Hello friends, welcome to my channel. Today I will share what I learned about Today I will share what I learned about Today I will share what I learned about the VDB nodes in geometry nodes in the VDB nodes in geometry nodes in the VDB nodes in geometry nodes in Blender.0. There's to be honest a bunch Blender.0. There's to be honest a bunch Blender.0. There's to be honest a bunch of nodes to learn also they are very of nodes to learn also they are very of nodes to learn also they are very useful. So I think it's worth to learn useful. So I think it's worth to learn useful. So I think it's worth to learn them and if you have dived into these them and if you have dived into these them and if you have dived into these nodes before you will find that blend nodes before you will find that blend nodes before you will find that blend developer platform for their articles developer platform for their articles developer platform for their articles about these nodes they introduced or about these nodes they introduced or about these nodes they introduced or what is the VDB there is some concept what is the VDB there is some concept what is the VDB there is some concept about grid and what's so and some usable about grid and what's so and some usable about grid and what's so and some usable nodes node system how to use them like nodes node system how to use them like nodes node system how to use them like there are VDB modeling If you are there are VDB modeling If you are there are VDB modeling If you are interested, I will put the link below. interested, I will put the link below. interested, I will put the link below. And uh today what I will share is based And uh today what I will share is based And uh today what I will share is based on my own experience and uh I will on my own experience and uh I will on my own experience and uh I will introduce them like following the introduce them like following the introduce them like following the sequence of the nodes in blend software sequence of the nodes in blend software sequence of the nodes in blend software and first let's talk about the concept and first let's talk about the concept and first let's talk about the concept of VDB in blend. So you can see there of VDB in blend. So you can see there of VDB in blend. So you can see there are monkey head here and there are cubes are monkey head here and there are cubes are monkey head here and there are cubes here. Uh I just uh like instance the here. Uh I just uh like instance the here. Uh I just uh like instance the cubes on the VDB cubes on the VDB cubes on the VDB like there is a cube here and I turn it like there is a cube here and I turn it like there is a cube here and I turn it turn it into VDB turn it into VDB turn it into VDB and I instanced like many cubes on it. and I instanced like many cubes on it. and I instanced like many cubes on it. So this will make you make it very So this will make you make it very So this will make you make it very easier for you to understand what is easier for you to understand what is easier for you to understand what is like the grid like there are many grids like the grid like there are many grids like the grid like there are many grids grids and and you can also understand grids and and you can also understand grids and and you can also understand that by this image provided by brand that by this image provided by brand that by this image provided by brand website. You can see there are small website. You can see there are small website. You can see there are small cubes. There are the grid and the grid cubes. There are the grid and the grid cubes. There are the grid and the grid contains information like density like contains information like density like contains information like density like velocity temperature and information velocity temperature and information velocity temperature and information about uh flame like that. about uh flame like that. about uh flame like that. Uh there is much small Uh there is much small Uh there is much small concept is the work. The grid is made of concept is the work. The grid is made of concept is the work. The grid is made of work and if you want to make like a very work and if you want to make like a very work and if you want to make like a very detailed effect you need to turn the detailed effect you need to turn the detailed effect you need to turn the grid into work by some nodes. I will grid into work by some nodes. I will grid into work by some nodes. I will introduce the nodes in this uh video. So introduce the nodes in this uh video. So introduce the nodes in this uh video. So you can see here the cubes means it's a you can see here the cubes means it's a you can see here the cubes means it's a grid contains information. If we want to grid contains information. If we want to grid contains information. If we want to define the number of a grid that you define the number of a grid that you define the number of a grid that you need to have XYZ need to have XYZ need to have XYZ three dimensions like index node we three dimensions like index node we three dimensions like index node we define the number of index in a geometry define the number of index in a geometry define the number of index in a geometry we use like integer one two 0 one two we use like integer one two 0 one two we use like integer one two 0 one two three uh but in VDB grid we will need to three uh but in VDB grid we will need to three uh but in VDB grid we will need to define like 0 0 define like 0 0 define like 0 0 uh 0 0 one like that. uh 0 0 one like that. uh 0 0 one like that. So, so XYZ So, so XYZ So, so XYZ uh three directions. So, after that I uh three directions. So, after that I uh three directions. So, after that I listed some nodes here like listed some nodes here like listed some nodes here like there there there is a sequence like in there there there is a sequence like in there there there is a sequence like in blend blend blend you can see uh there is a volume here you can see uh there is a volume here you can see uh there is a volume here and there is read sample write operation and there is read sample write operation and there is read sample write operation and primitive. So I follow this sequence and primitive. So I follow this sequence and primitive. So I follow this sequence and list all of the nodes here. And you and list all of the nodes here. And you and list all of the nodes here. And you can see here there are some nodes that can see here there are some nodes that can see here there are some nodes that isn't listed in the sequence. isn't listed in the sequence. isn't listed in the sequence. There are like somewhere in the node There are like somewhere in the node There are like somewhere in the node system but they also related to the DDB system but they also related to the DDB system but they also related to the DDB to the grid. So I listed them here. So I to the grid. So I listed them here. So I to the grid. So I listed them here. So I will follow the sequence here to will follow the sequence here to will follow the sequence here to introduce them one by one. introduce them one by one. introduce them one by one. So first we can see the primitive So first we can see the primitive So first we can see the primitive uh the volume cube. If we preview it you uh the volume cube. If we preview it you uh the volume cube. If we preview it you can see let me check missing output. We can see let me check missing output. We can see let me check missing output. We need out output here. So we preview that it's just a VDB cube. So we preview that it's just a VDB cube. So we preview that it's just a VDB cube. It contains information of density and It contains information of density and It contains information of density and the background. the background. the background. like I changed the density, like I changed the density, like I changed the density, change the background. It didn't work. change the background. It didn't work. change the background. It didn't work. Uh I don't know why it should work. Uh I don't know why it should work. Uh I don't know why it should work. So you can tweak this if you want it. So you can tweak this if you want it. So you can tweak this if you want it. It's very simple. It's very simple. It's very simple. And next we And next we And next we uh we will learn this this node there uh we will learn this this node there uh we will learn this this node there like change the match to grid. like change the match to grid. like change the match to grid. So uh I will call a match here. It's a So uh I will call a match here. It's a So uh I will call a match here. It's a monkey. So you can see there are SDF monkey. So you can see there are SDF monkey. So you can see there are SDF grid and the density grid and the grid and the density grid and the grid and the density grid and the volume. Uh the volume you must be very volume. Uh the volume you must be very volume. Uh the volume you must be very familiar with that like u familiar with that like u familiar with that like u it has existed for a long time. So if we it has existed for a long time. So if we it has existed for a long time. So if we link the monkey head to here and preview link the monkey head to here and preview link the monkey head to here and preview it, it turned it it into a monkey head. it, it turned it it into a monkey head. it, it turned it it into a monkey head. There's a volume here. So uh I disconnected this and So uh I disconnected this and So uh I disconnected this and the three nodes are new. So first I will the three nodes are new. So first I will the three nodes are new. So first I will check a match to SDF grid. So you can see So you can see So you can see if I turn the work down. if I turn the work down. if I turn the work down. uh maybe it's not very easy for you to uh maybe it's not very easy for you to uh maybe it's not very easy for you to see that see that see that I like bandwidth five bandwidth more I like bandwidth five bandwidth more I like bandwidth five bandwidth more bandwidth you can see a monkey head bandwidth you can see a monkey head bandwidth you can see a monkey head inside inside inside uh because SDF is like based on the like uh because SDF is like based on the like uh because SDF is like based on the like there is a distance there is a distance there is a distance this is this is this is the SDF grid grid is like uh especially the SDF grid grid is like uh especially the SDF grid grid is like uh especially for modeling and You can see this and if I link to and You can see this and if I link to and You can see this and if I link to point point point you can see this. you can see this. you can see this. So here I will introduce uh a node like So here I will introduce uh a node like So here I will introduce uh a node like turn the grid into turn the grid into turn the grid into mesh to so I use this grid to mesh to mesh to so I use this grid to mesh to mesh to so I use this grid to mesh to for for better understanding of this for for better understanding of this for for better understanding of this nodes. So this is like based on the so I nodes. So this is like based on the so I nodes. So this is like based on the so I preview this you can see there are many preview this you can see there are many preview this you can see there are many points. points. points. So uh the face has more points and like So uh the face has more points and like So uh the face has more points and like on the back of the head there are less on the back of the head there are less on the back of the head there are less points. So this points to SD SDF grid it points. So this points to SD SDF grid it points. So this points to SD SDF grid it mean it turned turned every point here mean it turned turned every point here mean it turned turned every point here into grade. into grade. into grade. So if I preview it, you can see So if I preview it, you can see So if I preview it, you can see every point is turned into grid. And if I connect the match to SF grid, And if I connect the match to SF grid, And if I connect the match to SF grid, so it will turn this mesh into grid. You so it will turn this mesh into grid. You so it will turn this mesh into grid. You can trick the work if you want. can trick the work if you want. can trick the work if you want. Uh so SDF grid is especially for Uh so SDF grid is especially for Uh so SDF grid is especially for modeling modeling modeling and here is matched to uh density grade. and here is matched to uh density grade. and here is matched to uh density grade. You can link it and preview it. Uh it will be like this. It's not for Uh it will be like this. It's not for Uh it will be like this. It's not for modeling. modeling. modeling. So the function of this SDF grid and the So the function of this SDF grid and the So the function of this SDF grid and the density grade is very different. The density grade is very different. The density grade is very different. The density grid contains the information of density grid contains the information of density grid contains the information of density. So these are the four nodes. Uh density. So these are the four nodes. Uh density. So these are the four nodes. Uh we will use them uh in the following we will use them uh in the following we will use them uh in the following introduction. And next we can see like introduction. And next we can see like introduction. And next we can see like get that name the read the raid get that name the read the raid get that name the read the raid information and the work index information and the work index information and the work index like if I like if I like if I build a volume cube here it uh it has a build a volume cube here it uh it has a build a volume cube here it uh it has a density information. density information. density information. So I can use the that name grid So I can use the that name grid So I can use the that name grid here and I preview it. So you can see a here and I preview it. So you can see a here and I preview it. So you can see a volume and if you check the grid you can volume and if you check the grid you can volume and if you check the grid you can see nothing because we didn't uh define see nothing because we didn't uh define see nothing because we didn't uh define what uh what attribute we want to get. what uh what attribute we want to get. what uh what attribute we want to get. So here we choose density. So we take So here we choose density. So we take So here we choose density. So we take the density and we get the volume. the density and we get the volume. the density and we get the volume. So So So uh and uh let's check this input a group input input a group input input a group input preview it. So you can see uh there is a flame here. So if I connect it to volume and preview it. So it can preview the preview it. So it can preview the preview it. So it can preview the density density density velocity because the velocity has XYZ3 velocity because the velocity has XYZ3 velocity because the velocity has XYZ3 value. So it correspond with the RGB. So value. So it correspond with the RGB. So value. So it correspond with the RGB. So it has color and the flame and the it has color and the flame and the it has color and the flame and the shadow and temperature shadow and temperature shadow and temperature like this. It will get the uh attribute like this. It will get the uh attribute like this. It will get the uh attribute inside the VDB and put it into a grid. And next is the grid information. So And next is the grid information. So And next is the grid information. So with this these nodes you can uh get the with this these nodes you can uh get the with this these nodes you can uh get the information of the grid like if you information of the grid like if you information of the grid like if you connect a grid here you can get the connect a grid here you can get the connect a grid here you can get the transport information and the background transport information and the background transport information and the background value. value. value. So transform is a metric background So transform is a metric background So transform is a metric background value is like the minimum value of this value is like the minimum value of this value is like the minimum value of this uh this uh like the minim minimum value uh this uh like the minim minimum value uh this uh like the minim minimum value in the parade. If you put if you have in the parade. If you put if you have in the parade. If you put if you have the density value so the minimum value the density value so the minimum value the density value so the minimum value of the density like for this the minimum of the density like for this the minimum of the density like for this the minimum density is zero density is zero density is zero and here we can get to the work index and here we can get to the work index and here we can get to the work index it is similar to this as I introduced in it is similar to this as I introduced in it is similar to this as I introduced in the beginning so it has the beginning so it has the beginning so it has three value three dimension So next we will go to sample. Sample is So next we will go to sample. Sample is So next we will go to sample. Sample is a very important node sample array. a very important node sample array. a very important node sample array. And here I use group input. Uh maybe not maybe just Uh maybe not maybe just Uh maybe not maybe just volume cube volume cube volume cube and I get the and I get the and I get the attribute of preview this. I need to attribute of preview this. I need to attribute of preview this. I need to first preview this attribute of density. first preview this attribute of density. first preview this attribute of density. uh then I can like uh reccast this uh then I can like uh reccast this uh then I can like uh reccast this density on a geometry. So density on a geometry. So density on a geometry. So uh we can use the uh we can use the uh we can use the sample sample sample. So we have like sampled the sample. So we have like sampled the sample. So we have like sampled the density uh we can't see anything because density uh we can't see anything because density uh we can't see anything because we have know we need a geometry to like we have know we need a geometry to like we have know we need a geometry to like uh do it. uh do it. uh do it. So but we need So but we need So but we need yeah yeah yeah and the geometry maybe and the geometry maybe and the geometry maybe I think the grid is good. I think the grid is good. I think the grid is good. So grid will make it bigger. So grid will make it bigger. So grid will make it bigger. And uh And uh And uh here here is the grid and here is the uh here here is the grid and here is the uh here here is the grid and here is the uh sampled attribute. So you can see it sampled attribute. So you can see it sampled attribute. So you can see it didn't work because we connected the the didn't work because we connected the the didn't work because we connected the the wrong sort wrong sort wrong sort to grade. to grade. to grade. So you can see the information here. So you can see the information here. So you can see the information here. So it means it don't have enough So it means it don't have enough So it means it don't have enough subdivision. So subdivision. So subdivision. So here I will give it a bigger value like here I will give it a bigger value like here I will give it a bigger value like You can see if we I open to 100. You can see inside if we I open to 100. You can see inside if we I open to 100. You can see inside it's one outside is zero and like in it's one outside is zero and like in it's one outside is zero and like in between there are like a numbers like between there are like a numbers like between there are like a numbers like this. So I need to turn off the So I need to turn off the So I need to turn off the text. So this is sample. So with uh this with So this is sample. So with uh this with So this is sample. So with uh this with this method you can like do a lot of this method you can like do a lot of this method you can like do a lot of things. After we sample that value we things. After we sample that value we things. After we sample that value we can like we can have like we can have like we can have uh like this this four nodes. So from uh like this this four nodes. So from uh like this this four nodes. So from this chart you can see that gradient this chart you can see that gradient this chart you can see that gradient will turn a scalar field into a vector will turn a scalar field into a vector will turn a scalar field into a vector and the curl in the vorticity like and the curl in the vorticity like and the curl in the vorticity like it it will turn like the velocity into it it will turn like the velocity into it it will turn like the velocity into divergence is like a describe uh field a divergence is like a describe uh field a divergence is like a describe uh field a field expansion or compression and that field expansion or compression and that field expansion or compression and that is about smoothness. Yes. is about smoothness. Yes. is about smoothness. Yes. So you can try them and here like uh I So you can try them and here like uh I So you can try them and here like uh I will show you how to use them. Like I will show you how to use them. Like I will show you how to use them. Like I think this volume cube is not very think this volume cube is not very think this volume cube is not very suitable for demonstration. Here I will suitable for demonstration. Here I will suitable for demonstration. Here I will use grid input. use grid input. use grid input. If I use this I can choose like If I use this I can choose like If I use this I can choose like like here many many. like here many many. like here many many. So I can see where it's here and you can see this you can see this you can see this uh this is the faz density I think. uh this is the faz density I think. uh this is the faz density I think. Yeah. Yeah. The fing density. So here we Yeah. Yeah. The fing density. So here we Yeah. Yeah. The fing density. So here we have this have this have this uh like black and white. uh like black and white. uh like black and white. So, so here here is a gradient so here here is a gradient so here here is a gradient a grid gradient. We can connect the grid a grid gradient. We can connect the grid a grid gradient. We can connect the grid here. It will turn it into gradient as I here. It will turn it into gradient as I here. It will turn it into gradient as I talk about talking about like this. talk about talking about like this. talk about talking about like this. This is the gradient. This is the gradient. This is the gradient. If you spread a particles here, it it If you spread a particles here, it it If you spread a particles here, it it can move the particles to make like some can move the particles to make like some can move the particles to make like some kind of effect like my last tutorial. kind of effect like my last tutorial. kind of effect like my last tutorial. And uh if you want to like the Ling you And uh if you want to like the Ling you And uh if you want to like the Ling you can try that what what effect it will can try that what what effect it will can try that what what effect it will make. You just connect here and then make. You just connect here and then make. You just connect here and then connect it to the grid. It will be like connect it to the grid. It will be like connect it to the grid. It will be like this. So you can try and this. So you can try and this. So you can try and and let me check if you want to use and let me check if you want to use and let me check if you want to use these two nodes you need like a these two nodes you need like a these two nodes you need like a threedimensional value. So here we have threedimensional value. So here we have threedimensional value. So here we have velocity. It's just crashed and I started again. It's just crashed and I started again. It's just crashed and I started again. So we disconnect this and turn into So we disconnect this and turn into So we disconnect this and turn into vector and we choose the velocity. So we vector and we choose the velocity. So we vector and we choose the velocity. So we have a like a 3D dimension attributes. have a like a 3D dimension attributes. have a like a 3D dimension attributes. So connected to like first we check the So connected to like first we check the So connected to like first we check the row effect like row effect like row effect like into vector into vector into vector row effect is like like this. row effect is like like this. row effect is like like this. No, here and it's a rect like this. No, here and it's a rect like this. No, here and it's a rect like this. So, uh So, uh So, uh normally we don't want the row effect. normally we don't want the row effect. normally we don't want the row effect. We want it like much like like much We want it like much like like much We want it like much like like much complicated effect. complicated effect. complicated effect. So, we turn into a turn the velocity So, we turn into a turn the velocity So, we turn into a turn the velocity into a work vorticity effect and change into a work vorticity effect and change into a work vorticity effect and change that you can have this. It's like uh you that you can have this. It's like uh you that you can have this. It's like uh you can try that spread some points in this can try that spread some points in this can try that spread some points in this space and you can see the effect space and you can see the effect space and you can see the effect and if you can you want to check this and if you can you want to check this and if you can you want to check this and al and al and al yeah yeah yeah if you can check this effect greater if you can check this effect greater if you can check this effect greater divergence you can connect here and uh like sample it need to be a float and uh like sample it need to be a float and uh like sample it need to be a float connect here it's like this uh so you connect here it's like this uh so you connect here it's like this uh so you can try to use them what effect you will can try to use them what effect you will can try to use them what effect you will have. So they are used here the four nodes. Okay. And here we have sample And here we have sample And here we have sample grade index and adapt grade. So this uh this nodes So this uh this nodes So this uh this nodes add back to grade it means it can like add back to grade it means it can like add back to grade it means it can like add uh two attribute field two attribute add uh two attribute field two attribute add uh two attribute field two attribute grade together to make a new grade like grade together to make a new grade like grade together to make a new grade like if here I will connect this to here. if here I will connect this to here. if here I will connect this to here. No into float preview into float preview into float preview into density. So I have a grid here and into density. So I have a grid here and into density. So I have a grid here and like you can connect the velocity here. like you can connect the velocity here. like you can connect the velocity here. Yeah, it will be like this. Yeah, it will be like this. Yeah, it will be like this. If you like uh let's try add a curl If you like uh let's try add a curl If you like uh let's try add a curl here. here. here. It will be like this. So, So, So, and let's try and let's try and let's try if we add a gradient here, it'll be like if we add a gradient here, it'll be like if we add a gradient here, it'll be like like this. So, so like this. So, so like this. So, so you can just try. you can just try. you can just try. Okay, that's great. It didn't crash. So, Okay, that's great. It didn't crash. So, Okay, that's great. It didn't crash. So, you can try to use them to make you can try to use them to make you can try to use them to make different effects. Just try. After that, different effects. Just try. After that, different effects. Just try. After that, we have a right. So store name attribute we have a right. So store name attribute we have a right. So store name attribute set background and set transform. set background and set transform. set background and set transform. So let's talk about these three nodes. So let's talk about these three nodes. So let's talk about these three nodes. Uh these three are very simple. Delete them. Delete them. So we have volume two here. And that's And that's And that's name the grid. So we have a grid like I name the grid. So we have a grid like I name the grid. So we have a grid like I preview this preview this preview this we can do the density and we have a cube we can do the density and we have a cube we can do the density and we have a cube here. here. here. Uh and we use output nodes output here. And let's check if we are output here. And let's check if we are output here. And let's check if we are Yeah. Delete this. Let's check if if we want to output the Let's check if if we want to output the Let's check if if we want to output the grid. Output grid like we can see nothing. We Output grid like we can see nothing. We Output grid like we can see nothing. We can't output the grid. can't output the grid. can't output the grid. So this this node here you link the G here and uh you have VB you link the G here and uh you have VB you link the G here and uh you have VB here. So it it can turn the like uh G here. So it it can turn the like uh G here. So it it can turn the like uh G the G because the G is like the the G because the G is like the the G because the G is like the combination combination combination combination of the attribute it's not combination of the attribute it's not combination of the attribute it's not VDB. So it can turn this attribute into VDB. So it can turn this attribute into VDB. So it can turn this attribute into uh VDB and output it. So then you can uh VDB and output it. So then you can uh VDB and output it. So then you can render this render this render this uh render this VB. So you can't render uh render this VB. So you can't render uh render this VB. So you can't render the grid. So this is where we use this the grid. So this is where we use this the grid. So this is where we use this spawn in the grid spawn in the grid spawn in the grid and for the set background. and for the set background. and for the set background. Let me check if Turn the density lower and set the Turn the density lower and set the Turn the density lower and set the background like it didn't work. So sometimes it like it didn't work. So sometimes it like it didn't work. So sometimes it worked. It's a uh yeah worked. It's a uh yeah worked. It's a uh yeah it's a plane and connect. So here here [snorts] I get the density. I get the density. I get the density. So here so this is the uh like smoke simulation. so this is the uh like smoke simulation. so this is the uh like smoke simulation. Uh so the background is like the minimum Uh so the background is like the minimum Uh so the background is like the minimum uh I get the density attribute for this uh I get the density attribute for this uh I get the density attribute for this grade. So this background background is grade. So this background background is grade. So this background background is like uh the minimum value of this like uh the minimum value of this like uh the minimum value of this density like and now it's zero. So the density like and now it's zero. So the density like and now it's zero. So the transparent part is zero. So if I turn transparent part is zero. So if I turn transparent part is zero. So if I turn it into one so normally all of them it into one so normally all of them it into one so normally all of them needed to be like it should be a four cube but I don't it should be a four cube but I don't it should be a four cube but I don't know why it's like this but it's a you know why it's like this but it's a you know why it's like this but it's a you can understand you can understand this can understand you can understand this can understand you can understand this it's a minimum value in the density if it's a minimum value in the density if it's a minimum value in the density if you increase it it's it's like over to you increase it it's it's like over to you increase it it's it's like over to like 26 six and set G transform is it's like much and set G transform is it's like much and set G transform is it's like much easier to understand. So if you link it easier to understand. So if you link it easier to understand. So if you link it it it will bigger like this. I don't it it will bigger like this. I don't it it will bigger like this. I don't know why I didn't change anything. So know why I didn't change anything. So know why I didn't change anything. So there is a trans transform here we talk there is a trans transform here we talk there is a trans transform here we talk about this it like about this it like about this it like here it will output the transform and here it will output the transform and here it will output the transform and the background value the background value the background value the g for. So background value is set by the g for. So background value is set by the g for. So background value is set by this node and transform value is set by this node and transform value is set by this node and transform value is set by this node. So we can combine metric combine metric combine metric or combine transform use these two nodes or other transform use these two nodes or other transform use these two nodes or other nodes nodes nodes uh you can make calculations. uh you can make calculations. uh you can make calculations. So if you So if you So if you yeah if you tweak the numbers it will yeah if you tweak the numbers it will yeah if you tweak the numbers it will correspond with your action. So rotation scale anything you can you So rotation scale anything you can you So rotation scale anything you can you can just change there can just change there can just change there very simple very simple very simple and here we go to operation. This is and here we go to operation. This is and here we go to operation. This is about uh normally about modeling. So we have So we have So we have like uh let me copy that. like uh let me copy that. like uh let me copy that. So G to mesh and volume to mesh. This is So G to mesh and volume to mesh. This is So G to mesh and volume to mesh. This is very easy to understand like very easy to understand like very easy to understand like a volume cube. If I connect this to this here is a volume cube. If I turn the here is a volume cube. If I turn the here is a volume cube. If I turn the volume into mesh, it will be like this. And like if you only have the density, you can't turn the density into density you can't turn the density into density you can't turn the density into density grad into mesh. So we need a G to mesh grad into mesh. So we need a G to mesh grad into mesh. So we need a G to mesh here. here. here. You turn into a mesh. So they are You turn into a mesh. So they are You turn into a mesh. So they are similar but used in uh different similar but used in uh different similar but used in uh different circumstance. And then And then And then uh we will go to SDF for B uh we will go to SDF for B uh we will go to SDF for B and there are these nodes. So you can see SDF grid is especially So you can see SDF grid is especially So you can see SDF grid is especially designed for modeling. designed for modeling. designed for modeling. As we talked about As we talked about As we talked about that we have a tube here like blender that we have a tube here like blender that we have a tube here like blender use this to show you how to use that. So use this to show you how to use that. So use this to show you how to use that. So I will rec recreate this uh this I will rec recreate this uh this I will rec recreate this uh this scenario scenario scenario we transform this cube this cylinder we transform this cube this cylinder we transform this cube this cylinder like this. Yeah. So I use the mask to SDF grid. It must So I use the mask to SDF grid. It must So I use the mask to SDF grid. It must be STF grid. Connect them. You can see copy it here. Connect them. copy it here. Connect them. copy it here. Connect them. There is a ceiling inside. So then I use the read to me then I use the read to me then I use the read to me that so the cube so the cube so the cube is like this. is like this. is like this. So we need a lower work like 0.1. Yeah, that's better. Yeah, that's better. Yeah, that's better. And for the cylinder. Yeah, smaller And for the cylinder. Yeah, smaller And for the cylinder. Yeah, smaller works. Yeah, that's better. works. Yeah, that's better. works. Yeah, that's better. So now we need to use SDF green boolean So now we need to use SDF green boolean So now we need to use SDF green boolean to like combine them together. It has to like combine them together. It has to like combine them together. It has the three mode intersection, union and the three mode intersection, union and the three mode intersection, union and the difference. So I connected. This is the difference. So I connected. This is the difference. So I connected. This is the difference. the difference. the difference. Like if I change the position of the Like if I change the position of the Like if I change the position of the cylinder. cylinder. cylinder. Yeah, you can see this is the bully Yeah, you can see this is the bully Yeah, you can see this is the bully difference and the union difference and the union difference and the union negative. Yeah, this is the union. This negative. Yeah, this is the union. This negative. Yeah, this is the union. This is the intersection. is the intersection. is the intersection. So you can try that by yourself. So you can try that by yourself. So you can try that by yourself. And there are some nodes here this way. So this one is a simple this way. So this one is a simple this way. So this one is a simple offset. offset. offset. You can see I will use union uniform. You can see I will use union uniform. You can see I will use union uniform. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Offset Yeah. Offset Yeah. Offset this expansion. H. Yeah. This is the contraction. H. Yeah. This is the contraction. H. Yeah. This is the contraction. So So So after that we talk about these nodes. after that we talk about these nodes. after that we talk about these nodes. They're all about the smooth but They're all about the smooth but They're all about the smooth but different effect. You can link the first different effect. You can link the first different effect. You can link the first grid fillet. grid fillet. grid fillet. You can see You can see You can see it is like this. If we try the it is like this. If we try the it is like this. If we try the G location, it will be like this. So you G location, it will be like this. So you G location, it will be like this. So you can decide which one you prefer on can decide which one you prefer on can decide which one you prefer on different occasion. different occasion. different occasion. They are very different here. Like this. Yeah. here like this. Yeah, Yeah. here like this. Yeah, Yeah. here like this. Yeah, very simple. And then we have the field to grid and And then we have the field to grid and And then we have the field to grid and works. So field to grid I think. Uh Uh Uh okay I deleted okay I deleted okay I deleted there is no system. H my blend crash because I lost that H my blend crash because I lost that H my blend crash because I lost that system. So I will rebuild this system. system. So I will rebuild this system. system. So I will rebuild this system. So I will build a system here to So I will build a system here to So I will build a system here to density. Yeah. density. Yeah. density. Yeah. And I use a field to And I use a field to And I use a field to the read here. So it has nothing. the read here. So it has nothing. the read here. So it has nothing. So this node like we can use some So this node like we can use some So this node like we can use some attribute like a noise or other attribute like a noise or other attribute like a noise or other attribute. You can define some certain attribute. You can define some certain attribute. You can define some certain attribute to affect the grid system. So attribute to affect the grid system. So attribute to affect the grid system. So here I here I use noise here I use noise here I use noise connect this connect this connect this and I think I need to use a ramp here. and I think I need to use a ramp here. and I think I need to use a ramp here. Let's check it. Let's check it. Let's check it. So I know I think it's not very easy to So I know I think it's not very easy to So I know I think it's not very easy to see that see that see that as we know grid is created by attribute as we know grid is created by attribute as we know grid is created by attribute inside. So I think we can use node here. inside. So I think we can use node here. inside. So I think we can use node here. Uh we can use the multiply Uh we can use the multiply Uh we can use the multiply add the attribute. It will be like this. Uh so let's check before Uh so let's check before Uh so let's check before before it's like a cube and after we use before it's like a cube and after we use before it's like a cube and after we use noise it's like this. So this is what noise it's like this. So this is what noise it's like this. So this is what this node is for. this node is for. this node is for. You can use like other attribute to You can use like other attribute to You can use like other attribute to affect the g system. affect the g system. affect the g system. So for work li and prune. So as we So for work li and prune. So as we So for work li and prune. So as we talked about in the beginning, the so is talked about in the beginning, the so is talked about in the beginning, the so is like very uh like a rough level and the like very uh like a rough level and the like very uh like a rough level and the work is very detailed detailed work is very detailed detailed work is very detailed detailed uh level and the smallest element is. So uh level and the smallest element is. So uh level and the smallest element is. So you want to make like a many very you want to make like a many very you want to make like a many very detailed effect you need to use the work detailed effect you need to use the work detailed effect you need to use the work to vulize the grade to release the full to vulize the grade to release the full to vulize the grade to release the full performance. performance. performance. So like this So like this So like this you edit that it will be like this. And you edit that it will be like this. And you edit that it will be like this. And I change it the scale. So it looks like I change it the scale. So it looks like I change it the scale. So it looks like this. And Peru is like the this. And Peru is like the this. And Peru is like the uh like the invert invert work slides. uh like the invert invert work slides. uh like the invert invert work slides. If you yeah I have connected them. If If you yeah I have connected them. If If you yeah I have connected them. If you turn the value into one so it return you turn the value into one so it return you turn the value into one so it return into the uh the mode. If I turn to zero, into the uh the mode. If I turn to zero, into the uh the mode. If I turn to zero, it turn into the vualized mode. it turn into the vualized mode. it turn into the vualized mode. So sometimes you want to save computer So sometimes you want to save computer So sometimes you want to save computer performance, you can use the nodes to do performance, you can use the nodes to do performance, you can use the nodes to do something. And I think I finished all something. And I think I finished all something. And I think I finished all the introduction. I think the VDB nodes the introduction. I think the VDB nodes the introduction. I think the VDB nodes updated in Blender 5.0 updated in Blender 5.0 updated in Blender 5.0 is like a very big update. There's a lot is like a very big update. There's a lot is like a very big update. There's a lot of nodes to learn. of nodes to learn. of nodes to learn.
