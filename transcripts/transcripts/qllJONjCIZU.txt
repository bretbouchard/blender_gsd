I'm CG Matter and in this video I'm I'm CG Matter and in this video I'm I'm CG Matter and in this video I'm going to show you how to do edge erosion going to show you how to do edge erosion going to show you how to do edge erosion and erosion on the surface. The and erosion on the surface. The and erosion on the surface. The algorithm for edgeware is you take your algorithm for edgeware is you take your algorithm for edgeware is you take your mesh and you find edges that are very mesh and you find edges that are very mesh and you find edges that are very sharp in a sense. We are then going to sharp in a sense. We are then going to sharp in a sense. We are then going to thicken them, vary the radius, remesh thicken them, vary the radius, remesh thicken them, vary the radius, remesh just for safety, apply one more just for safety, apply one more just for safety, apply one more distortion, and we're going to take the distortion, and we're going to take the distortion, and we're going to take the original mesh and cut out the new one. original mesh and cut out the new one. original mesh and cut out the new one. And that is edgewware. For the face And that is edgewware. For the face And that is edgewware. For the face erosion, we are going to spawn points erosion, we are going to spawn points erosion, we are going to spawn points all over this mesh. We're going to get all over this mesh. We're going to get all over this mesh. We're going to get rid of some of them, remesh cloud using rid of some of them, remesh cloud using rid of some of them, remesh cloud using SDFs, add a bit of distortion, and again SDFs, add a bit of distortion, and again SDFs, add a bit of distortion, and again take our original and cut away this. take our original and cut away this. take our original and cut away this. This video is brought to you by This video is brought to you by This video is brought to you by Squarespace, but we are going to talk Squarespace, but we are going to talk Squarespace, but we are going to talk about that later. So, for our starter about that later. So, for our starter about that later. So, for our starter mesh, let's do something simple like a mesh, let's do something simple like a mesh, let's do something simple like a cube, which can then be swapped later. I cube, which can then be swapped later. I cube, which can then be swapped later. I need to isolate the sharp edges here, need to isolate the sharp edges here, need to isolate the sharp edges here, which in this case is all the edges. So, which in this case is all the edges. So, which in this case is all the edges. So, I'm going to take the edge angle node, I'm going to take the edge angle node, I'm going to take the edge angle node, which can give me the angle of every which can give me the angle of every which can give me the angle of every edge. I don't care about the sign, if edge. I don't care about the sign, if edge. I don't care about the sign, if it's positive or negative. I just need it's positive or negative. I just need it's positive or negative. I just need to know is this angle bigger than a to know is this angle bigger than a to know is this angle bigger than a certain number. This will be in radians, certain number. This will be in radians, certain number. This will be in radians, so it's not like 0 to 90°, it's 0 to so it's not like 0 to 90°, it's 0 to so it's not like 0 to 90°, it's 0 to p&lt;unk&gt; over4. So, I'm just going to make p&lt;unk&gt; over4. So, I'm just going to make p&lt;unk&gt; over4. So, I'm just going to make this a value like 6 for now. We are then this a value like 6 for now. We are then this a value like 6 for now. We are then going to isolate these edges by doing a going to isolate these edges by doing a going to isolate these edges by doing a separate geometry and let's isolate the separate geometry and let's isolate the separate geometry and let's isolate the edges that fit this criteria. And then edges that fit this criteria. And then edges that fit this criteria. And then you see there's still remaining faces. you see there's still remaining faces. you see there's still remaining faces. So I am going to delete geometry all the So I am going to delete geometry all the So I am going to delete geometry all the faces. So delete faces only edges or I faces. So delete faces only edges or I faces. So delete faces only edges or I guess only faces. Now to check that this guess only faces. Now to check that this guess only faces. Now to check that this is working, I'm going to take my cube is working, I'm going to take my cube is working, I'm going to take my cube and add some divisions to it. So and add some divisions to it. So and add some divisions to it. So something like 4x4. If I look at the something like 4x4. If I look at the something like 4x4. If I look at the result, you can see it's only those result, you can see it's only those result, you can see it's only those harsh edges. It doesn't care about the harsh edges. It doesn't care about the harsh edges. It doesn't care about the ones in the middle. Okay. Now let's make ones in the middle. Okay. Now let's make ones in the middle. Okay. Now let's make them solid in a sense. Blender 5.0 know them solid in a sense. Blender 5.0 know them solid in a sense. Blender 5.0 know boasts about the tube node. I'm not I'm boasts about the tube node. I'm not I'm boasts about the tube node. I'm not I'm not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that. I mean, look look not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that. I mean, look look not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that. I mean, look look at this. So, what I'm going to use at this. So, what I'm going to use at this. So, what I'm going to use instead is if you go to my website instead is if you go to my website instead is if you go to my website cgmatter.com, so cgmatter.com, you go to cgmatter.com, so cgmatter.com, you go to cgmatter.com, so cgmatter.com, you go to free nodes, you can get all the nodes I free nodes, you can get all the nodes I free nodes, you can get all the nodes I use for absolutely free. You don't need use for absolutely free. You don't need use for absolutely free. You don't need to be a member. And then with that, I'm to be a member. And then with that, I'm to be a member. And then with that, I'm going to use my tube node. That's going going to use my tube node. That's going going to use my tube node. That's going to require that the input is a curve. to require that the input is a curve. to require that the input is a curve. So, we're going to do a mesh to curve. So, we're going to do a mesh to curve. So, we're going to do a mesh to curve. And boom. Let's see that in solid view. And boom. Let's see that in solid view. And boom. Let's see that in solid view. We are going to decrease the radius, We are going to decrease the radius, We are going to decrease the radius, fill the gaps, and now we've solidified fill the gaps, and now we've solidified fill the gaps, and now we've solidified this. In a case like this, and this is this. In a case like this, and this is this. In a case like this, and this is very important, these curves aren't very important, these curves aren't very important, these curves aren't going to connect. And because we're going to connect. And because we're going to connect. And because we're doing booleans, ideally with manifolds, doing booleans, ideally with manifolds, doing booleans, ideally with manifolds, we want it to be one solid thing. I'm we want it to be one solid thing. I'm we want it to be one solid thing. I'm also going to use my SDF remesh node also going to use my SDF remesh node also going to use my SDF remesh node that just kind of voluminizes this. And that just kind of voluminizes this. And that just kind of voluminizes this. And then increase the quality. Divide this then increase the quality. Divide this then increase the quality. Divide this by 10. This is kind of like a resolution by 10. This is kind of like a resolution by 10. This is kind of like a resolution slider. And you can see we got really slider. And you can see we got really slider. And you can see we got really good geo here. Now, you can see this good geo here. Now, you can see this good geo here. Now, you can see this isn't very detailed. It's going to work. isn't very detailed. It's going to work. isn't very detailed. It's going to work. We can cut one thing from another, but I We can cut one thing from another, but I We can cut one thing from another, but I want more variety. So, in this curved want more variety. So, in this curved want more variety. So, in this curved tube node, you can see we can control tube node, you can see we can control tube node, you can see we can control kind of the size of this. Let's use a kind of the size of this. Let's use a kind of the size of this. Let's use a noise texture node to decide that noise texture node to decide that noise texture node to decide that radius. Connect that into the radius. radius. Connect that into the radius. radius. Connect that into the radius. And we got to make sure that, you know, And we got to make sure that, you know, And we got to make sure that, you know, by default it's around 0.02. So I'm by default it's around 0.02. So I'm by default it's around 0.02. So I'm going to map range to kind of constrain going to map range to kind of constrain going to map range to kind of constrain this 0.01 to like 0.02. You're going to this 0.01 to like 0.02. You're going to this 0.01 to like 0.02. You're going to see this doesn't like really do anything see this doesn't like really do anything see this doesn't like really do anything like it changes it a little. This is like it changes it a little. This is like it changes it a little. This is because our curves don't have any because our curves don't have any because our curves don't have any geometry, right? There's one here, a geometry, right? There's one here, a geometry, right? There's one here, a point here. There's nothing in between point here. There's nothing in between point here. There's nothing in between to give it resolution. So finally, I'm to give it resolution. So finally, I'm to give it resolution. So finally, I'm going to take this and I'm going to run going to take this and I'm going to run going to take this and I'm going to run a reample curve for like 100 points or a reample curve for like 100 points or a reample curve for like 100 points or something like that. Let's add even more something like that. Let's add even more something like that. Let's add even more variety. This can go lower. This can go variety. This can go lower. This can go variety. This can go lower. This can go a bit higher. And we want to bring up a bit higher. And we want to bring up a bit higher. And we want to bring up the contrast. So point4 to 6. Now that the contrast. So point4 to 6. Now that the contrast. So point4 to 6. Now that we have that, it's always a good idea to we have that, it's always a good idea to we have that, it's always a good idea to consolidate. So I'm going to turn this consolidate. So I'm going to turn this consolidate. So I'm going to turn this control G into a node group. The only control G into a node group. The only control G into a node group. The only thing I would like to control is thing I would like to control is thing I would like to control is probably the kind of maximum angle. And probably the kind of maximum angle. And probably the kind of maximum angle. And this can be called our edge selector. this can be called our edge selector. this can be called our edge selector. And then once we're happy with our And then once we're happy with our And then once we're happy with our distortion, this can also be a node. distortion, this can also be a node. distortion, this can also be a node. Noisy tube. Please don't call me that. Noisy tube. Please don't call me that. Noisy tube. Please don't call me that. Lastly, we have our SDF remsh. If you Lastly, we have our SDF remsh. If you Lastly, we have our SDF remsh. If you see it inflates it a little, you can use see it inflates it a little, you can use see it inflates it a little, you can use this threshold slider over here, which this threshold slider over here, which this threshold slider over here, which basically says how tight to the mesh basically says how tight to the mesh basically says how tight to the mesh should you go. So instead of 01, let's should you go. So instead of 01, let's should you go. So instead of 01, let's do O1. Finally, let's add a bit more do O1. Finally, let's add a bit more do O1. Finally, let's add a bit more detail with my distort node. Again, detail with my distort node. Again, detail with my distort node. Again, cgmatter.com. I'm going to take the cgmatter.com. I'm going to take the cgmatter.com. I'm going to take the strength, bring it down a lot, maybe strength, bring it down a lot, maybe strength, bring it down a lot, maybe bring up the scale and the detail, and bring up the scale and the detail, and bring up the scale and the detail, and then finally, of course, bring this down then finally, of course, bring this down then finally, of course, bring this down even more. So now, if we take a look, we even more. So now, if we take a look, we even more. So now, if we take a look, we have our cube. We selected the edges. We have our cube. We selected the edges. We have our cube. We selected the edges. We turned it into a mesh. We turned it into turned it into a mesh. We turned it into turned it into a mesh. We turned it into an SDF that we distorted. And now I just an SDF that we distorted. And now I just an SDF that we distorted. And now I just cut one from another because these are cut one from another because these are cut one from another because these are both manifold. They're good meshes. Good both manifold. They're good meshes. Good both manifold. They're good meshes. Good little mesh. Good little mesh. I'm going little mesh. Good little mesh. I'm going little mesh. Good little mesh. I'm going to run this through a mesh boolean, to run this through a mesh boolean, to run this through a mesh boolean, taking the difference between our taking the difference between our taking the difference between our original and our distorted one. I would original and our distorted one. I would original and our distorted one. I would highly recommend using the manifold highly recommend using the manifold highly recommend using the manifold mode. And let's see what that looks mode. And let's see what that looks mode. And let's see what that looks like. So now we have this nice edgeware like. So now we have this nice edgeware like. So now we have this nice edgeware that if I go into noisy tube, add a that if I go into noisy tube, add a that if I go into noisy tube, add a multiplier to the radius over here, set multiplier to the radius over here, set multiplier to the radius over here, set this to multiply, make that a parameter, this to multiply, make that a parameter, this to multiply, make that a parameter, now I can vary the radius on the fly. now I can vary the radius on the fly. now I can vary the radius on the fly. Procedural erosion on the edges. Now the Procedural erosion on the edges. Now the Procedural erosion on the edges. Now the key part of this is it works on any key part of this is it works on any key part of this is it works on any mesh. Any mesh. If I take this cube and mesh. Any mesh. If I take this cube and mesh. Any mesh. If I take this cube and I replace it with a cylinder like this, I replace it with a cylinder like this, I replace it with a cylinder like this, you can see now it's eroded only the you can see now it's eroded only the you can see now it's eroded only the sharp edges, not these ones over here. sharp edges, not these ones over here. sharp edges, not these ones over here. So, if I was to take this angle and make So, if I was to take this angle and make So, if I was to take this angle and make it like too small of a number, you're it like too small of a number, you're it like too small of a number, you're going to see it kind of does this to going to see it kind of does this to going to see it kind of does this to every single edge, which might be what every single edge, which might be what every single edge, which might be what you want. I assume it isn't. So, I'm you want. I assume it isn't. So, I'm you want. I assume it isn't. So, I'm going to get rid of that. In fact, I'm going to get rid of that. In fact, I'm going to get rid of that. In fact, I'm going to get rid of the cylinder and use going to get rid of the cylinder and use going to get rid of the cylinder and use a group input, which is going to let me a group input, which is going to let me a group input, which is going to let me model my own thing. I can then take model my own thing. I can then take model my own thing. I can then take this, I can insert, I can extrude, and this, I can insert, I can extrude, and this, I can insert, I can extrude, and on the fly, it's going to add that on the fly, it's going to add that on the fly, it's going to add that erosion. Let's take this, do a vertex erosion. Let's take this, do a vertex erosion. Let's take this, do a vertex bevel, just like that. And you have your bevel, just like that. And you have your bevel, just like that. And you have your nice procedural erosion. Notice this nice procedural erosion. Notice this nice procedural erosion. Notice this isn't going to work on very smooth isn't going to work on very smooth isn't going to work on very smooth surfaces because our edge angle is quite surfaces because our edge angle is quite surfaces because our edge angle is quite big. But if I was to bring this to zero, big. But if I was to bring this to zero, big. But if I was to bring this to zero, you can see all of the sudden we have you can see all of the sudden we have you can see all of the sudden we have erosion everywhere. And now I'm going to erosion everywhere. And now I'm going to erosion everywhere. And now I'm going to move on to face erosion. But before you move on to face erosion. But before you move on to face erosion. But before you do that, there's something you need to do that, there's something you need to do that, there's something you need to know.

Damn right I am. If all this sounds good to you, head over to sounds good to you, head over to sounds good to you, head over to Squarespace, make a website, and when Squarespace, make a website, and when Squarespace, make a website, and when you're ready to take that and launch, you're ready to take that and launch, you're ready to take that and launch, use this link in the description to save use this link in the description to save use this link in the description to save 10% off your first purchase of a website 10% off your first purchase of a website 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain. And now, let's do face or domain. And now, let's do face or domain. And now, let's do face erosion. The logic is going to be pretty erosion. The logic is going to be pretty erosion. The logic is going to be pretty similar. We're just going to use similar. We're just going to use similar. We're just going to use different things to cut away. So, I'm different things to cut away. So, I'm different things to cut away. So, I'm going to take all of this, maybe make it going to take all of this, maybe make it going to take all of this, maybe make it a nice node group. I can call this edge a nice node group. I can call this edge a nice node group. I can call this edge erosion, which you would add parameters erosion, which you would add parameters erosion, which you would add parameters for. Goodbye, edge erosion. You've for. Goodbye, edge erosion. You've for. Goodbye, edge erosion. You've served us well. Like I said, for this served us well. Like I said, for this served us well. Like I said, for this one, we need to spawn points on the one, we need to spawn points on the one, we need to spawn points on the surface. I'm going to distribute points surface. I'm going to distribute points surface. I'm going to distribute points on faces. Just make that a ridiculously on faces. Just make that a ridiculously on faces. Just make that a ridiculously big number. I'm talking like 1500 or big number. I'm talking like 1500 or big number. I'm talking like 1500 or something like that. And this will something like that. And this will something like that. And this will dictate where our erosion is going to dictate where our erosion is going to dictate where our erosion is going to be. I don't want that everywhere. So, be. I don't want that everywhere. So, be. I don't want that everywhere. So, I'm going to delete geometry. Where am I I'm going to delete geometry. Where am I I'm going to delete geometry. Where am I going to do that, you ask? Well, I'm going to do that, you ask? Well, I'm going to do that, you ask? Well, I'm going to use a noise texture. Turn off going to use a noise texture. Turn off going to use a noise texture. Turn off normalize so that this is positive or normalize so that this is positive or normalize so that this is positive or negative. Delete or don't delete. negative. Delete or don't delete. negative. Delete or don't delete. Connect that here. And now, when we play Connect that here. And now, when we play Connect that here. And now, when we play with this, you can get rid of points in with this, you can get rid of points in with this, you can get rid of points in different areas. In fact, we can bias different areas. In fact, we can bias different areas. In fact, we can bias this by adding or subtracting something. this by adding or subtracting something. this by adding or subtracting something. So, now you can see we're getting rid of So, now you can see we're getting rid of So, now you can see we're getting rid of more or less. And then this needs to be more or less. And then this needs to be more or less. And then this needs to be made into a mesh where we can cut one made into a mesh where we can cut one made into a mesh where we can cut one thing from another. Well, the new 5.0, 0 thing from another. Well, the new 5.0, 0 thing from another. Well, the new 5.0, 0 at least as of recording. SDF nodes are at least as of recording. SDF nodes are at least as of recording. SDF nodes are great for that. We're going to run a great for that. We're going to run a great for that. We're going to run a points to SDF. This will make it a nice points to SDF. This will make it a nice points to SDF. This will make it a nice volutric that you can kind of make the volutric that you can kind of make the volutric that you can kind of make the impression of this. For the size of impression of this. For the size of impression of this. For the size of this, like how far away from the points this, like how far away from the points this, like how far away from the points are you looking? You could just plug in are you looking? You could just plug in are you looking? You could just plug in the radius, which we can modify on the the radius, which we can modify on the the radius, which we can modify on the fly. And we're going to take our voxil fly. And we're going to take our voxil fly. And we're going to take our voxil or our resolution, kind of like the or our resolution, kind of like the or our resolution, kind of like the inverse of it, like the size of a pixel. inverse of it, like the size of a pixel. inverse of it, like the size of a pixel. And I am going to bring that down. Now, And I am going to bring that down. Now, And I am going to bring that down. Now, we're going to clean this up in a we're going to clean this up in a we're going to clean this up in a second, but for now, let's run a grid to second, but for now, let's run a grid to second, but for now, let's run a grid to mesh. Turn it into an SDF grid. Turn it mesh. Turn it into an SDF grid. Turn it mesh. Turn it into an SDF grid. Turn it back into a mesh. SDF is just a nice way back into a mesh. SDF is just a nice way back into a mesh. SDF is just a nice way to go back and forth. And now you can to go back and forth. And now you can to go back and forth. And now you can see our initial point cloud that we see our initial point cloud that we see our initial point cloud that we called turned into a mesh. Take the called turned into a mesh. Take the called turned into a mesh. Take the voxil, make it smaller. Now it's higher voxil, make it smaller. Now it's higher voxil, make it smaller. Now it's higher resolution. And our radius, since we're resolution. And our radius, since we're resolution. And our radius, since we're using that, let's make that smaller. So using that, let's make that smaller. So using that, let's make that smaller. So set point radius. Divide that by like set point radius. Divide that by like set point radius. Divide that by like three. Let's go a little higher so that three. Let's go a little higher so that three. Let's go a little higher so that they're more connected. And now we're they're more connected. And now we're they're more connected. And now we're going to take our original mesh, which going to take our original mesh, which going to take our original mesh, which is the Taurus, and of course subtract is the Taurus, and of course subtract is the Taurus, and of course subtract away this. The way we constructed this away this. The way we constructed this away this. The way we constructed this is it should be a very nice SDF. Should is it should be a very nice SDF. Should is it should be a very nice SDF. Should be. Connect this here. Connect this be. Connect this here. Connect this be. Connect this here. Connect this here. And set this to manifold. And now here. And set this to manifold. And now here. And set this to manifold. And now we preview that. And now we have very we preview that. And now we have very we preview that. And now we have very nice face erosion that we can change on nice face erosion that we can change on nice face erosion that we can change on the fly for erosion. Now, if you're the fly for erosion. Now, if you're the fly for erosion. Now, if you're seeing kind of these hovering pieces, seeing kind of these hovering pieces, seeing kind of these hovering pieces, right, that means that our point thing right, that means that our point thing right, that means that our point thing kind of has holes in it, which is fine. kind of has holes in it, which is fine. kind of has holes in it, which is fine. Like there's holes between the points. Like there's holes between the points. Like there's holes between the points. Bring up the density. Now, the quality Bring up the density. Now, the quality Bring up the density. Now, the quality of this erosion is going to be fully of this erosion is going to be fully of this erosion is going to be fully dependent on our noise texture. So, if I dependent on our noise texture. So, if I dependent on our noise texture. So, if I bring up the detail and then I bring up bring up the detail and then I bring up bring up the detail and then I bring up the roughness, you can see now it looks the roughness, you can see now it looks the roughness, you can see now it looks more cut out. That's going to be more more cut out. That's going to be more more cut out. That's going to be more obvious as I take our SDF and bring up obvious as I take our SDF and bring up obvious as I take our SDF and bring up the resolution. And it computes quite the resolution. And it computes quite the resolution. And it computes quite fast and we haven't even baked it yet. fast and we haven't even baked it yet. fast and we haven't even baked it yet. One thing you might notice is wherever One thing you might notice is wherever One thing you might notice is wherever it's eroded, it kind of goes to the same it's eroded, it kind of goes to the same it's eroded, it kind of goes to the same depth. And that makes sense because our depth. And that makes sense because our depth. And that makes sense because our guiding points are all the exact same guiding points are all the exact same guiding points are all the exact same radius. So, what if we took our like SDF radius. So, what if we took our like SDF radius. So, what if we took our like SDF grid and the radius that's driving it, grid and the radius that's driving it, grid and the radius that's driving it, we just vary it a little. I'm going to we just vary it a little. I'm going to we just vary it a little. I'm going to take the radius. And we got to be take the radius. And we got to be take the radius. And we got to be careful. We're going to multiply by a careful. We're going to multiply by a careful. We're going to multiply by a random number. So, they're not all the random number. So, they're not all the random number. So, they're not all the same. Maybe like.5 to 1.2. And now, same. Maybe like.5 to 1.2. And now, same. Maybe like.5 to 1.2. And now, let's do a comparison. Before, after. let's do a comparison. Before, after. let's do a comparison. Before, after. Before, after. To get this even higher Before, after. To get this even higher Before, after. To get this even higher quality or more erosion. Here is what quality or more erosion. Here is what quality or more erosion. Here is what I'm going to do. I'm going to take our I'm going to do. I'm going to take our I'm going to do. I'm going to take our meshed point cloud. And this is meshed point cloud. And this is meshed point cloud. And this is something that I can also distort. Run something that I can also distort. Run something that I can also distort. Run my distort node inside of here. Make my distort node inside of here. Make my distort node inside of here. Make that very tiny. More detail, more that very tiny. More detail, more that very tiny. More detail, more roughness. And then even tinier. So roughness. And then even tinier. So roughness. And then even tinier. So before, after. Now, if you look at our before, after. Now, if you look at our before, after. Now, if you look at our erosion, you can see we're kind of erosion, you can see we're kind of erosion, you can see we're kind of breaking up the pattern a little. For breaking up the pattern a little. For breaking up the pattern a little. For even more detail before the distortion, even more detail before the distortion, even more detail before the distortion, you just add a bit more geo with a you just add a bit more geo with a you just add a bit more geo with a subdivide. And now you have more, you subdivide. And now you have more, you subdivide. And now you have more, you know, detail. So let's get rid of this know, detail. So let's get rid of this know, detail. So let's get rid of this Taurus and do something simple like a Taurus and do something simple like a Taurus and do something simple like a cube. I'm seeing that the splotches are cube. I'm seeing that the splotches are cube. I'm seeing that the splotches are a little too, I don't know, they're a little too, I don't know, they're a little too, I don't know, they're splotchy. So I'm going to take the noise splotchy. So I'm going to take the noise splotchy. So I'm going to take the noise texture. I'm going to bring down the texture. I'm going to bring down the texture. I'm going to bring down the scale. bring down the detail a little. scale. bring down the detail a little. scale. bring down the detail a little. And now you can see these chunks are a And now you can see these chunks are a And now you can see these chunks are a lot bigger. And we can take that much lot bigger. And we can take that much lot bigger. And we can take that much further. So we erode only a section of further. So we erode only a section of further. So we erode only a section of it. And then we also run our edge it. And then we also run our edge it. And then we also run our edge erosion. And that's that. But right now, erosion. And that's that. But right now, erosion. And that's that. But right now, this looks pretty good to me. So I'm this looks pretty good to me. So I'm this looks pretty good to me. So I'm going to take everything we did here. going to take everything we did here. going to take everything we did here. Ctrl + G to make it a node group. So now Ctrl + G to make it a node group. So now Ctrl + G to make it a node group. So now we have the whole dream team. And we now we have the whole dream team. And we now we have the whole dream team. And we now want to delete some of the floaters. want to delete some of the floaters. want to delete some of the floaters. Here's a little floater for example. The Here's a little floater for example. The Here's a little floater for example. The way we isolate it even visually is we way we isolate it even visually is we way we isolate it even visually is we say, ah, this little island over here say, ah, this little island over here say, ah, this little island over here much smaller than the rest. In other much smaller than the rest. In other much smaller than the rest. In other words, I can take the mesh island node words, I can take the mesh island node words, I can take the mesh island node that will tell us what island does each that will tell us what island does each that will tell us what island does each belong to. You can see that different belong to. You can see that different belong to. You can see that different islands, so this one's purple and then islands, so this one's purple and then islands, so this one's purple and then this one's yellow or whatever, um, have this one's yellow or whatever, um, have this one's yellow or whatever, um, have different values. And then for each different values. And then for each different values. And then for each island, what I can do is I can island, what I can do is I can island, what I can do is I can accumulate on every island separately accumulate on every island separately accumulate on every island separately the face area. So face area like that. the face area. So face area like that. the face area. So face area like that. What does this mean? This means that the What does this mean? This means that the What does this mean? This means that the total is going to give me the total total is going to give me the total total is going to give me the total surface area of each island. And if that surface area of each island. And if that surface area of each island. And if that total is very tiny under a threshold, total is very tiny under a threshold, total is very tiny under a threshold, then we're going to delete it. Delete then we're going to delete it. Delete then we're going to delete it. Delete geometry. If the total is less than, geometry. If the total is less than, geometry. If the total is less than, we'll figure out what that number should we'll figure out what that number should we'll figure out what that number should be. So, if I set this to one, that be. So, if I set this to one, that be. So, if I set this to one, that already cleans it up perfectly while already cleans it up perfectly while already cleans it up perfectly while preserving the whole thing. So, here preserving the whole thing. So, here preserving the whole thing. So, here I've taken my mesh and absolutely I've taken my mesh and absolutely I've taken my mesh and absolutely destroyed it. If I use my delete destroyed it. If I use my delete destroyed it. If I use my delete geometry, you can see automatically geometry, you can see automatically geometry, you can see automatically cleans it up actually surprisingly well. cleans it up actually surprisingly well. cleans it up actually surprisingly well.
