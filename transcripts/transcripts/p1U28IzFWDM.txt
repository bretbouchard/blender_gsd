Hello everyone and welcome to today's Hello everyone and welcome to today's Hello everyone and welcome to today's live stream where we have 20 new nodes live stream where we have 20 new nodes live stream where we have 20 new nodes to uh look through. So uh some major to uh look through. So uh some major to uh look through. So uh some major things have happened since last time uh things have happened since last time uh things have happened since last time uh I streamed. Uh the volume nodes got I streamed. Uh the volume nodes got I streamed. Uh the volume nodes got pulled out of experimental and pulled out of experimental and pulled out of experimental and apparently like 10 new nodes got added apparently like 10 new nodes got added apparently like 10 new nodes got added with new PRs this week. Uh there has with new PRs this week. Uh there has with new PRs this week. Uh there has been one I believe community developer I been one I believe community developer I been one I believe community developer I think the creator of molecular nodes the think the creator of molecular nodes the think the creator of molecular nodes the add-on I'll need to double check that add-on I'll need to double check that add-on I'll need to double check that who uh basically was really cooking with who uh basically was really cooking with who uh basically was really cooking with the open BDB part and added in a ton of the open BDB part and added in a ton of the open BDB part and added in a ton of nodes. So for those of you are wondering nodes. So for those of you are wondering nodes. So for those of you are wondering it allows us to do stuff like this. Now it allows us to do stuff like this. Now it allows us to do stuff like this. Now apparently there's another node on the apparently there's another node on the apparently there's another node on the way called the advect node which might way called the advect node which might way called the advect node which might make it into 5.0 go, which would allow make it into 5.0 go, which would allow make it into 5.0 go, which would allow for just straight up simulations, like for just straight up simulations, like for just straight up simulations, like volume simulations. volume simulations. volume simulations. Uh, but apparently there's a lot of cool Uh, but apparently there's a lot of cool Uh, but apparently there's a lot of cool stuff on the way. So, let's get into it. stuff on the way. So, let's get into it. stuff on the way. So, let's get into it. So, it's all to do with grids, which are So, it's all to do with grids, which are So, it's all to do with grids, which are like volumes, but they are quirky, and I like volumes, but they are quirky, and I like volumes, but they are quirky, and I don't fully know how they work yet. I'm don't fully know how they work yet. I'm don't fully know how they work yet. I'm trying to figure that out as we speak. trying to figure that out as we speak. trying to figure that out as we speak. But grids are kind of like fields, but But grids are kind of like fields, but But grids are kind of like fields, but they can kind of live differently they can kind of live differently they can kind of live differently compared to fields, and they're kind of compared to fields, and they're kind of compared to fields, and they're kind of like lists as well. They are quirky and like lists as well. They are quirky and like lists as well. They are quirky and I do not fully understand them. They're I do not fully understand them. They're I do not fully understand them. They're their own data type, but they can kind their own data type, but they can kind their own data type, but they can kind of exist outside of like the regular of exist outside of like the regular of exist outside of like the regular geometry flow. So, a lot to go over. So, geometry flow. So, a lot to go over. So, geometry flow. So, a lot to go over. So, let's go and take a look at that. let's go and take a look at that. let's go and take a look at that. Actually, I need to get the Blender 5.0 Actually, I need to get the Blender 5.0 Actually, I need to get the Blender 5.0 change log up. 5.0 change log. I'll have change log up. 5.0 change log. I'll have change log up. 5.0 change log. I'll have that up on the side. Geometry nodes. So, yeah, geometry Geometry nodes. So, yeah, geometry Geometry nodes. So, yeah, geometry nodes. It there was going to be good nodes. It there was going to be good nodes. It there was going to be good stuff in 5.0 know anyway, but we just stuff in 5.0 know anyway, but we just stuff in 5.0 know anyway, but we just got like a massive amount of stuff. got like a massive amount of stuff. got like a massive amount of stuff. But yes, let's take a look at this. So, But yes, let's take a look at this. So, But yes, let's take a look at this. So, in the volume section, we got new things in the volume section, we got new things in the volume section, we got new things for like get named grid, kind of like for like get named grid, kind of like for like get named grid, kind of like the get named attributes. But this one the get named attributes. But this one the get named attributes. But this one is interesting because it takes in a is interesting because it takes in a is interesting because it takes in a geometry input and then outputs a grid, geometry input and then outputs a grid, geometry input and then outputs a grid, which I was wondering, wait, why is it which I was wondering, wait, why is it which I was wondering, wait, why is it not like these uh named attribute node? not like these uh named attribute node? not like these uh named attribute node? But the reason for that, I think, is But the reason for that, I think, is But the reason for that, I think, is because these can just straight up live because these can just straight up live because these can just straight up live separately from the geometry itself, separately from the geometry itself, separately from the geometry itself, which is weird and quirky, and I needed which is weird and quirky, and I needed which is weird and quirky, and I needed to figure out how that works. Uh, so to figure out how that works. Uh, so to figure out how that works. Uh, so yeah, there's that. There's the grid yeah, there's that. There's the grid yeah, there's that. There's the grid info, which I think is just like I think info, which I think is just like I think info, which I think is just like I think the transform is like the location and the transform is like the location and the transform is like the location and like the scale of it because these can like the scale of it because these can like the scale of it because these can apparently be sparse potentially. I apparently be sparse potentially. I apparently be sparse potentially. I don't know. I'm not sure. I'll be saying don't know. I'm not sure. I'll be saying don't know. I'm not sure. I'll be saying that a lot today. and then voxil index that a lot today. and then voxil index that a lot today. and then voxil index and then like stuff like that. I'm not and then like stuff like that. I'm not and then like stuff like that. I'm not sure actually. Let's take a look at the sure actually. Let's take a look at the sure actually. Let's take a look at the tool tips. Let's see. Retrieve integer tool tips. Let's see. Retrieve integer tool tips. Let's see. Retrieve integer coordinates of the voxhole that the coordinates of the voxhole that the coordinates of the voxhole that the field is evaluated on. Oh, so that's for field is evaluated on. Oh, so that's for field is evaluated on. Oh, so that's for a field. What? Oh, okay. Okay. Grid info a field. What? Oh, okay. Okay. Grid info a field. What? Oh, okay. Okay. Grid info information about the volume grid. And information about the volume grid. And information about the volume grid. And then that get a volume grid from a then that get a volume grid from a then that get a volume grid from a volume geometry. And then sample grid uh volume geometry. And then sample grid uh volume geometry. And then sample grid uh retrieves values from the grid. sample retrieves values from the grid. sample retrieves values from the grid. sample grid index grid curl divergence gradient grid index grid curl divergence gradient grid index grid curl divergence gradient and lelation. I'm assuming these at the and lelation. I'm assuming these at the and lelation. I'm assuming these at the moment can even do volume simulation, moment can even do volume simulation, moment can even do volume simulation, but the advect one will make it a lot but the advect one will make it a lot but the advect one will make it a lot simpler. Uh, I should also mention Oh, simpler. Uh, I should also mention Oh, simpler. Uh, I should also mention Oh, music is a bit much. Oh, sorry. Dang, music is a bit much. Oh, sorry. Dang, music is a bit much. Oh, sorry. Dang, it's so much quieter on my headphones. it's so much quieter on my headphones. it's so much quieter on my headphones. Actually, you know what? I'm just going Actually, you know what? I'm just going Actually, you know what? I'm just going to lower it in OBS. to lower it in OBS. to lower it in OBS. I am so sorry, everyone. I am so sorry, everyone. I am so sorry, everyone. There we go. That should be a good There we go. That should be a good There we go. That should be a good amount better. Uh, sorry about that amount better. Uh, sorry about that amount better. Uh, sorry about that everyone. This music will probably get everyone. This music will probably get everyone. This music will probably get copyright claimed even though it copyright claimed even though it copyright claimed even though it shouldn't. So, but this stream is shouldn't. So, but this stream is shouldn't. So, but this stream is temporary as well. So, we'll just keep temporary as well. So, we'll just keep temporary as well. So, we'll just keep going and seeing what's going on and see going and seeing what's going on and see going and seeing what's going on and see what goes on. So, yeah, we got store what goes on. So, yeah, we got store what goes on. So, yeah, we got store named grid, set grid background, and set named grid, set grid background, and set named grid, set grid background, and set grid transform. Now, I want to play with grid transform. Now, I want to play with grid transform. Now, I want to play with this because this is probably very Oh, this because this is probably very Oh, this because this is probably very Oh, it's a singular value. it's a singular value. it's a singular value. Oh. Oh. Oh. Huh. Huh. Huh. How about that? How about that? How about that? Interesting. New toys. Yes, that is what Interesting. New toys. Yes, that is what Interesting. New toys. Yes, that is what it feels like. A volume to mesh. Grid to it feels like. A volume to mesh. Grid to it feels like. A volume to mesh. Grid to mesh. Now, people are going to get mesh. Now, people are going to get mesh. Now, people are going to get confused with the difference between a confused with the difference between a confused with the difference between a volume and a grid. Uh myself included. volume and a grid. Uh myself included. volume and a grid. Uh myself included. Field to grid. Prune grid. Let's see. Field to grid. Prune grid. Let's see. Field to grid. Prune grid. Let's see. Make a storage tiles or inner nodes. Oh, I'm assuming. tiles or inner nodes. Oh, I'm assuming. tiles or inner nodes. Oh, I'm assuming. And then there's box. So I assume that And then there's box. So I assume that And then there's box. So I assume that these two are like inverses of each these two are like inverses of each these two are like inverses of each other. Uh wait other. Uh wait other. Uh wait box grid. So one will like make it box grid. So one will like make it box grid. So one will like make it sparse and one will make it into even sparse and one will make it into even sparse and one will make it into even boxels. Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Very very interesting. Uh, Interesting. Very very interesting. Uh, Interesting. Very very interesting. Uh, I guess we can go and test this out a I guess we can go and test this out a I guess we can go and test this out a little bit because with this setup right little bit because with this setup right little bit because with this setup right here, it takes a volume cube like this here, it takes a volume cube like this here, it takes a volume cube like this as just a sphere. And then in here, we as just a sphere. And then in here, we as just a sphere. And then in here, we get the named grid. We separate it. We get the named grid. We separate it. We get the named grid. We separate it. We voxalize it cuz it led to some errors voxalize it cuz it led to some errors voxalize it cuz it led to some errors before. Uh, and then we sample the grid before. Uh, and then we sample the grid before. Uh, and then we sample the grid and then we change the field to a grid and then we change the field to a grid and then we change the field to a grid while keeping the previous topology. I while keeping the previous topology. I while keeping the previous topology. I know it's weird. And then we store the know it's weird. And then we store the know it's weird. And then we store the named grid. So, it's more complicated named grid. So, it's more complicated named grid. So, it's more complicated and hopefully we can make node groups and hopefully we can make node groups and hopefully we can make node groups where the user will never have to do where the user will never have to do where the user will never have to do this themselves because that would be a this themselves because that would be a this themselves because that would be a little bit annoying to do every single little bit annoying to do every single little bit annoying to do every single time, but I'm assuming that's 100% time, but I'm assuming that's 100% time, but I'm assuming that's 100% possible. possible. possible. Uh, okay. So, if I do not voxilize the Uh, okay. So, if I do not voxilize the Uh, okay. So, if I do not voxilize the grid, we should see some weird artifacts grid, we should see some weird artifacts grid, we should see some weird artifacts internally. Yes, right here or here. internally. Yes, right here or here. internally. Yes, right here or here. It's a bit difficult to see, but here we It's a bit difficult to see, but here we It's a bit difficult to see, but here we can see that that cube is much bigger can see that that cube is much bigger can see that that cube is much bigger than it should be. And I'm assum than it should be. And I'm assum than it should be. And I'm assum actually wait is there a grid to points? actually wait is there a grid to points? actually wait is there a grid to points? Uh grid to points. Nope. I Okay, I don't think that points. Nope. I Okay, I don't think that points. Nope. I Okay, I don't think that node is in here yet. I saw someone was node is in here yet. I saw someone was node is in here yet. I saw someone was working on it. Let's see. Points. working on it. Let's see. Points. working on it. Let's see. Points. Points to SDF grid. Nope. Uh points to Points to SDF grid. Nope. Uh points to Points to SDF grid. Nope. Uh points to vertices. vertices. vertices. [Music] [Music] [Music] Derby points and grid. Nope. Volume Derby points and grid. Nope. Volume Derby points and grid. Nope. Volume read. read. read. No. H interesting. Uh let me just see No. H interesting. Uh let me just see No. H interesting. Uh let me just see what I can do right here. So here we're what I can do right here. So here we're what I can do right here. So here we're just going to go and manipulate the just going to go and manipulate the just going to go and manipulate the value. So a nice multiply right here. value. So a nice multiply right here. value. So a nice multiply right here. Let's set it to be 10. I just want to Let's set it to be 10. I just want to Let's set it to be 10. I just want to see what's actually going on in there. see what's actually going on in there. see what's actually going on in there. there w I think there was going to be a there w I think there was going to be a there w I think there was going to be a node where you can turn each of the node where you can turn each of the node where you can turn each of the voxil voxil voxil cells into points and get all the data cells into points and get all the data cells into points and get all the data but I don't think that's in currently but I don't think that's in currently but I don't think that's in currently not the most important thing in the not the most important thing in the not the most important thing in the world but it would make debugging this a world but it would make debugging this a world but it would make debugging this a little bit easier but yeah we can see little bit easier but yeah we can see little bit easier but yeah we can see the main grid and then kind of the sub the main grid and then kind of the sub the main grid and then kind of the sub grids there so if I were to voxalize grids there so if I were to voxalize grids there so if I were to voxalize that we can see actually wait I can go that we can see actually wait I can go that we can see actually wait I can go and just test this normally Yeah. Wow, that is interesting. But why Yeah. Wow, that is interesting. But why Yeah. Wow, that is interesting. But why is that? Oh, is this going into the is that? Oh, is this going into the is that? Oh, is this going into the negatives again? negatives again? negatives again? Yeah, cuz the background is negative Yeah, cuz the background is negative Yeah, cuz the background is negative one. So, if I just set that to there. one. So, if I just set that to there. one. So, if I just set that to there. Oh, it just disappears into the ether. Oh, it just disappears into the ether. Oh, it just disappears into the ether. Okay. Need that to be like at least Okay. Need that to be like at least Okay. Need that to be like at least negative a little bit. Yes. Okay. So, it negative a little bit. Yes. Okay. So, it negative a little bit. Yes. Okay. So, it doesn't really like it when it's a doesn't really like it when it's a doesn't really like it when it's a negative background, but it doesn't negative background, but it doesn't negative background, but it doesn't fully know how to handle it. fully know how to handle it. fully know how to handle it. Could try. And no, that wouldn't work. Could try. And no, that wouldn't work. Could try. And no, that wouldn't work. Yeah, we can see that that's happening. Yeah, we can see that that's happening. Yeah, we can see that that's happening. That looks normal when we do this. It That looks normal when we do this. It That looks normal when we do this. It just does not work as intended. So, you just does not work as intended. So, you just does not work as intended. So, you need to actually voxilize the said grid need to actually voxilize the said grid need to actually voxilize the said grid for it to work as intended. And right for it to work as intended. And right for it to work as intended. And right here, we have a resolution of 75 cubed. here, we have a resolution of 75 cubed. here, we have a resolution of 75 cubed. So, and performance seems to be fairly So, and performance seems to be fairly So, and performance seems to be fairly standard for because all this runs on standard for because all this runs on standard for because all this runs on the CPU, not the GPU, as expected. the CPU, not the GPU, as expected. the CPU, not the GPU, as expected. Let's see. But yeah, what can we do Let's see. But yeah, what can we do Let's see. But yeah, what can we do here? So, I want to try a few things here? So, I want to try a few things here? So, I want to try a few things again. Getting and setting the again. Getting and setting the again. Getting and setting the attributes are still a little bit weird. attributes are still a little bit weird. attributes are still a little bit weird. Oh, actually, wait a minute. I can just Oh, actually, wait a minute. I can just Oh, actually, wait a minute. I can just boxize this beforehand. boxize this beforehand. boxize this beforehand. Although, Although, Although, yeah, I know that would work. So, I need yeah, I know that would work. So, I need yeah, I know that would work. So, I need to get it, set it so it doesn't have to to get it, set it so it doesn't have to to get it, set it so it doesn't have to reoxalize every time, reoxalize every time, reoxalize every time, I think. Let's see if this is actually I think. Let's see if this is actually I think. Let's see if this is actually faster. So if we mute that then let that faster. So if we mute that then let that faster. So if we mute that then let that run. It runs normally. run. It runs normally. run. It runs normally. I mean it is pretty much exactly the I mean it is pretty much exactly the I mean it is pretty much exactly the same. I guess that's good. Or actually same. I guess that's good. Or actually same. I guess that's good. Or actually wait what? Oh no that's that is just the wait what? Oh no that's that is just the wait what? Oh no that's that is just the baking going through its course. baking going through its course. baking going through its course. Okay so here we are. That's pretty good. Okay so here we are. That's pretty good. Okay so here we are. That's pretty good. So with this we can eliminate a node. So So with this we can eliminate a node. So So with this we can eliminate a node. So we have all that and that is fine. we have all that and that is fine. we have all that and that is fine. Let's see what we can do. Actually, Let's see what we can do. Actually, Let's see what we can do. Actually, let's attach this right here. Oh, nope. let's attach this right here. Oh, nope. let's attach this right here. Oh, nope. Let's get the named grid, bring it over Let's get the named grid, bring it over Let's get the named grid, bring it over here, check the part right there, and here, check the part right there, and here, check the part right there, and use the viewer to check the singular use the viewer to check the singular use the viewer to check the singular value because we can do that now. So, if value because we can do that now. So, if value because we can do that now. So, if we go into the spreadsheet, 5.0 is we go into the spreadsheet, 5.0 is we go into the spreadsheet, 5.0 is looking pretty good. Let's check the looking pretty good. Let's check the looking pretty good. Let's check the viewer node. Go to the Where is the viewer node. Go to the Where is the viewer node. Go to the Where is the um um um Ah, is that one collapsed by default? Ah, is that one collapsed by default? Ah, is that one collapsed by default? Ah, it is. Okay, Ah, it is. Okay, Ah, it is. Okay, we can see that that is Yep. we can see that that is Yep. we can see that that is Yep. Interesting. Why is it like that? I need to think about that because it I need to think about that because it I need to think about that because it has a negative value in the last parts has a negative value in the last parts has a negative value in the last parts of the grid. Let's see. Is that rotation or scale? Let's see. Is that rotation or scale? Let's see. Is that rotation or scale? I don't know. I forget which parts of I don't know. I forget which parts of I don't know. I forget which parts of the 4x4 matrix are what. Well, if we set the 4x4 matrix are what. Well, if we set the 4x4 matrix are what. Well, if we set the grid transform, let's actually try the grid transform, let's actually try the grid transform, let's actually try that. that. that. So, here. Oh, wait. Let me go and bring So, here. Oh, wait. Let me go and bring So, here. Oh, wait. Let me go and bring this over to H. We can put that there. this over to H. We can put that there. this over to H. We can put that there. Is valid. Intriguing. Most intriguing. Is valid. Intriguing. Most intriguing. Is valid. Intriguing. Most intriguing. and then we can get it afterwards and and then we can get it afterwards and and then we can get it afterwards and see what happens see what happens see what happens right there. right there. right there. So that yep that's an identity matrix So that yep that's an identity matrix So that yep that's an identity matrix and no visual changes have occurred and no visual changes have occurred and no visual changes have occurred uh because I'm looking at the wrong uh because I'm looking at the wrong uh because I'm looking at the wrong thing but there we go. So we can see a thing but there we go. So we can see a thing but there we go. So we can see a change has occurred which is it just change has occurred which is it just change has occurred which is it just being completely eliminated. being completely eliminated. being completely eliminated. Um combine transform. So, what are you? Um combine transform. So, what are you? Um combine transform. So, what are you? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, Oh, Oh, interesting. interesting. interesting. Why do you act like that? Why do you act like that? Why do you act like that? So, this is like setting the scale. Oh, So, this is like setting the scale. Oh, So, this is like setting the scale. Oh, is the default scale 111? is the default scale 111? is the default scale 111? So, this is 75 m long and such. Oh, that So, this is 75 m long and such. Oh, that So, this is 75 m long and such. Oh, that actually makes a good amount of sense actually makes a good amount of sense actually makes a good amount of sense because that feels like something I because that feels like something I because that feels like something I would do. And I've actually tried doing would do. And I've actually tried doing would do. And I've actually tried doing volumes like this in the past. H. volumes like this in the past. H. volumes like this in the past. H. Then we can move it as well, though. It Then we can move it as well, though. It Then we can move it as well, though. It seems like uh volume rendering is a bit seems like uh volume rendering is a bit seems like uh volume rendering is a bit funky at the moment. Unless it's just because part of it is Unless it's just because part of it is Unless it's just because part of it is negative, even though the lowest value negative, even though the lowest value negative, even though the lowest value that should exist here is.1, that should exist here is.1, that should exist here is.1, but that could also happen. but that could also happen. but that could also happen. Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. So, So, So, oh wait, I think it just clicked. I oh wait, I think it just clicked. I oh wait, I think it just clicked. I think it just clicked in my brain. What think it just clicked in my brain. What think it just clicked in my brain. What happens here? So, the geometry here is happens here? So, the geometry here is happens here? So, the geometry here is No, that doesn't make sense. At least a No, that doesn't make sense. At least a No, that doesn't make sense. At least a grid is a ton of values, a ton of voxels grid is a ton of values, a ton of voxels grid is a ton of values, a ton of voxels in space, and then the transform decides in space, and then the transform decides in space, and then the transform decides where it is. So, if you have 75 voxels where it is. So, if you have 75 voxels where it is. So, if you have 75 voxels and you make it fit in a certain space, and you make it fit in a certain space, and you make it fit in a certain space, it'll just go and compress it. it'll just go and compress it. it'll just go and compress it. But what does the geometry line have to But what does the geometry line have to But what does the geometry line have to do with this? What does it do with this? What does it do with this? What does it Oh, it can hold multiple. Oh, okay. This Oh, it can hold multiple. Oh, okay. This Oh, it can hold multiple. Oh, okay. This can hold multiple grids. That can hold multiple grids. That can hold multiple grids. That Okay, I think I think I got it now. Okay, I think I think I got it now. Okay, I think I think I got it now. I think I got it now. So, if you have I think I got it now. So, if you have I think I got it now. So, if you have multiple grids in a geometry, they don't multiple grids in a geometry, they don't multiple grids in a geometry, they don't need to be the same density, the same, need to be the same density, the same, need to be the same density, the same, they can be sparse, they can be fully they can be sparse, they can be fully they can be sparse, they can be fully voxalized and so on. You can just store voxalized and so on. You can just store voxalized and so on. You can just store as many volumes as you want in a volume as many volumes as you want in a volume as many volumes as you want in a volume in the geometry line, but the actual in the geometry line, but the actual in the geometry line, but the actual grid itself is that grid itself is that grid itself is that interesting. interesting. interesting. I guess it's almost like instances or I guess it's almost like instances or I guess it's almost like instances or layers in a sense. layers in a sense. layers in a sense. Maybe I'll need to I'll need to think Maybe I'll need to I'll need to think Maybe I'll need to I'll need to think more about that later. And again getting more about that later. And again getting more about that later. And again getting the voxal index h I'm assuming that's the self index. So I'm assuming that's the self index. So I'm assuming that's the self index. So the extent the extent the extent ah okay how many voxels are in one ah okay how many voxels are in one ah okay how many voxels are in one direction. Yes. I remember making a node direction. Yes. I remember making a node direction. Yes. I remember making a node like this for one of my volumeish. It like this for one of my volumeish. It like this for one of my volumeish. It was just like a point 3D point cloud was just like a point 3D point cloud was just like a point 3D point cloud that you would just go and sample other that you would just go and sample other that you would just go and sample other things. But it's nice that we have this things. But it's nice that we have this things. But it's nice that we have this under the hood because that was such a under the hood because that was such a under the hood because that was such a pain to make. pain to make. pain to make. Dang. Okay, so let's go and try some new Dang. Okay, so let's go and try some new Dang. Okay, so let's go and try some new stuff with this node setup that I have. stuff with this node setup that I have. stuff with this node setup that I have. Uh, first of all, let me go and copy it Uh, first of all, let me go and copy it Uh, first of all, let me go and copy it so that I don't lose all of my work and so that I don't lose all of my work and so that I don't lose all of my work and make sure make sure make sure go that's all defaulted and out of the go that's all defaulted and out of the go that's all defaulted and out of the way. way. way. So, I want to try getting some velocity So, I want to try getting some velocity So, I want to try getting some velocity going. Now, this will not work the way I going. Now, this will not work the way I going. Now, this will not work the way I want to because I don't remember how want to because I don't remember how want to because I don't remember how divergence actually works. divergence actually works. divergence actually works. Um, Um, Um, let's make let's make let's make or we can just go and set a grid. Set grid value. Set grid value. Set grid value. [Music] [Music] [Music] Wait. Uh, set names grid. Okay. Wait. Uh, set names grid. Okay. Wait. Uh, set names grid. Okay. Wait, Wait, Wait, what? Um, oh, store, right? Um, oh, store, right? Um, oh, store, right? Uh, let's name this Vel for velocity. Uh, let's name this Vel for velocity. Uh, let's name this Vel for velocity. Though again, this will not work the way Though again, this will not work the way Though again, this will not work the way I intend, at least on the first five I intend, at least on the first five I intend, at least on the first five goes. So, if we store this goes. So, if we store this goes. So, if we store this here, here, here, what am I missing? Oh, fields. Okay. So, what am I missing? Oh, fields. Okay. So, what am I missing? Oh, fields. Okay. So, this is the quirky quirky part about this is the quirky quirky part about this is the quirky quirky part about this. Uh, okay. So, we have the topology which Uh, okay. So, we have the topology which Uh, okay. So, we have the topology which is just the form of it. This is very is just the form of it. This is very is just the form of it. This is very quirky. quirky. quirky. And then we can make that a value. And then we can make that a value. And then we can make that a value. Give some m [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh, extension sockets are acting a bit Oh, extension sockets are acting a bit Oh, extension sockets are acting a bit weird with that apparently. weird with that apparently. weird with that apparently. Um Um Um h let us see. Oh, and other news. The uh h let us see. Oh, and other news. The uh h let us see. Oh, and other news. The uh attribute transform constraint has been attribute transform constraint has been attribute transform constraint has been renamed to the geometry attribute renamed to the geometry attribute renamed to the geometry attribute constraints and might actually make into constraints and might actually make into constraints and might actually make into 5.0. I wasn't too sure for a little 5.0. I wasn't too sure for a little 5.0. I wasn't too sure for a little while there, but it seems like one of while there, but it seems like one of while there, but it seems like one of the devs um asked around and it can make the devs um asked around and it can make the devs um asked around and it can make it in. It might make it in. I'd say it in. It might make it in. I'd say it in. It might make it in. I'd say there's uh a good chance. So, that is there's uh a good chance. So, that is there's uh a good chance. So, that is still being worked on still being worked on still being worked on and hopefully it can be it can make it and hopefully it can be it can make it and hopefully it can be it can make it in. I hope. I really really really hope. in. I hope. I really really really hope. in. I hope. I really really really hope. So, let's get Vel right over here. So So, let's get Vel right over here. So So, let's get Vel right over here. So yeah, grids are very quirky. yeah, grids are very quirky. yeah, grids are very quirky. So if we get that and do that. Oh wait, ample grid at the position at the ample grid at the position at the ample grid at the position at the current position. current position. current position. And that'll be that or no wait, that And that'll be that or no wait, that And that'll be that or no wait, that needs to be a vector that needs to go needs to be a vector that needs to go needs to be a vector that needs to go into there. And then that has to go into there. And then that has to go into there. And then that has to go here. So, we're converting one to the here. So, we're converting one to the here. So, we're converting one to the This is probably going to be mega This is probably going to be mega This is probably going to be mega inefficient. inefficient. inefficient. Um, but hey, here's to trying it. No, we Um, but hey, here's to trying it. No, we Um, but hey, here's to trying it. No, we don't want that. We want this to be fed don't want that. We want this to be fed don't want that. We want this to be fed into here. Nope, not that one. That one. into here. Nope, not that one. That one. into here. Nope, not that one. That one. Let's see. Can that possibly work. Looks Let's see. Can that possibly work. Looks Let's see. Can that possibly work. Looks like it does. Okay. like it does. Okay. like it does. Okay. And we need to make sure that our And we need to make sure that our And we need to make sure that our velocity also gets transferred back so velocity also gets transferred back so velocity also gets transferred back so that it updates. And I'm using uh the that it updates. And I'm using uh the that it updates. And I'm using uh the nearest neighbor because the other nearest neighbor because the other nearest neighbor because the other versions like to lose data. I'm assuming versions like to lose data. I'm assuming versions like to lose data. I'm assuming that's from Divergence or something that's from Divergence or something that's from Divergence or something along those What the heck? Oh, wait. along those What the heck? Oh, wait. along those What the heck? Oh, wait. That good thing that didn't show the That good thing that didn't show the That good thing that didn't show the whole thing cuz I think that was whole thing cuz I think that was whole thing cuz I think that was probably my stream key, probably my stream key, probably my stream key, the temporary one. So, no, you cannot the temporary one. So, no, you cannot the temporary one. So, no, you cannot use it to use it to use it to hack my stream or anything like that. hack my stream or anything like that. hack my stream or anything like that. Okay. Now, does the grid Does this Okay. Now, does the grid Does this Okay. Now, does the grid Does this contain No, it does not contain the contain No, it does not contain the contain No, it does not contain the attributes. attributes. attributes. So, So, So, if only there was a way to sample a grid if only there was a way to sample a grid if only there was a way to sample a grid and get all the delicious data from it. and get all the delicious data from it. and get all the delicious data from it. So, if I were to do this, in theory, I So, if I were to do this, in theory, I So, if I were to do this, in theory, I would be able to transfer the color, would be able to transfer the color, would be able to transfer the color, the velocity over to there and store it the velocity over to there and store it the velocity over to there and store it here. here. here. Hey, now let's go and set a nice Hey, now let's go and set a nice Hey, now let's go and set a nice material. material. material. In theory, you're all right here.

Uh, all this will probably be Blender. Uh, all this will probably be in the next daily build tomorrow, but I in the next daily build tomorrow, but I in the next daily build tomorrow, but I just built it myself because I could just built it myself because I could just built it myself because I could and I like playing with toys as soon as and I like playing with toys as soon as and I like playing with toys as soon as they come out. Let's go and take a look they come out. Let's go and take a look they come out. Let's go and take a look at this. And oh, would you look at that? at this. And oh, would you look at that? at this. And oh, would you look at that? It worked. It worked. It worked. So now I can debug what's going on. Even So now I can debug what's going on. Even So now I can debug what's going on. Even though the viewer node should be able to though the viewer node should be able to though the viewer node should be able to debug, debug, debug, right? Not quite. Oh well. Uh I guess we can use this for Oh well. Uh I guess we can use this for Oh well. Uh I guess we can use this for viewing. viewing. viewing. So, we can see that the velocity So, we can see that the velocity So, we can see that the velocity apparently is apparently is apparently is not doing anything, not doing anything, not doing anything, but we are setting the velocity. but we are setting the velocity. but we are setting the velocity. So, it should at the very least Oh, So, it should at the very least Oh, So, it should at the very least Oh, that's why. that's why. that's why. What the hell? Oh, that's weird. Oh, that's weird. Oh, that's weird. I know why that happened, but I know why that happened, but I know why that happened, but yeah. Yeah. No, that's quirky. yeah. Yeah. No, that's quirky. yeah. Yeah. No, that's quirky. We can sample the grid, then we do that, We can sample the grid, then we do that, We can sample the grid, then we do that, and then we sample the grid again, and and then we sample the grid again, and and then we sample the grid again, and then we pass that version along. then we pass that version along. then we pass that version along. Okay, let's uh give that a shot. Okay, let's uh give that a shot. Okay, let's uh give that a shot. So, that is moving the velocity around So, that is moving the velocity around So, that is moving the velocity around with everything else, but with everything else, but with everything else, but doesn't do that. doesn't do that. doesn't do that. So, I think that's where the volume So, I think that's where the volume So, I think that's where the volume curl divergence curl divergence curl divergence and stuff would occur cuz if I did that and stuff would occur cuz if I did that and stuff would occur cuz if I did that Oh, whoa. What the Oh, whoa. What the Oh, whoa. What the I caused an explosion. I caused an explosion. I caused an explosion. H I should probably figure out what curl H I should probably figure out what curl H I should probably figure out what curl actually does. So, great curl. The actually does. So, great curl.

The magnitude and direction magnitude and direction magnitude and direction of circulation of a directional vector of circulation of a directional vector of circulation of a directional vector grid. The magnitude and direction. How grid. The magnitude and direction. How grid. The magnitude and direction. How would it know the magnitude and would it know the magnitude and would it know the magnitude and direction inside one vector? Hm. Hm. Hm. I mean, it could just be normalized, but I mean, it could just be normalized, but I mean, it could just be normalized, but I thought that I thought that I thought that h and then divergence is how much values h and then divergence is how much values h and then divergence is how much values like low and stuff. I know I I know how like low and stuff. I know I I know how like low and stuff. I know I I know how all this works 100%. all this works 100%. all this works 100%. And then we scale depending on the And then we scale depending on the And then we scale depending on the divergence. Or maybe that should be like divergence. Or maybe that should be like divergence. Or maybe that should be like a one divided. a one divided. a one divided. I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. Oh, fun. Oh, fun. Oh, fun. Probably didn't do anything though.

Uh let's try this one. H. H. H. Quirky. Quirky Quirky. Quirky Quirky. Quirky merge. But actually, no, that should be just But actually, no, that should be just But actually, no, that should be just fine. No, we do need to sample the Okay, this No, we do need to sample the Okay, this No, we do need to sample the Okay, this is even this is weird even for me to is even this is weird even for me to is even this is weird even for me to wrap my head around just because like wrap my head around just because like wrap my head around just because like grids grids grids it's very different from geometry it's very different from geometry it's very different from geometry because these grids are kind of separate because these grids are kind of separate because these grids are kind of separate from it. from it. from it.

H [Music] Let's see. Hey, I want I'm watching from Let's see. Hey, I want I'm watching from Let's see. Hey, I want I'm watching from the start, not live. I want to say that the start, not live. I want to say that the start, not live. I want to say that by default SDF grids and density grids by default SDF grids and density grids by default SDF grids and density grids are sparse in all this. Fox grid is good are sparse in all this. Fox grid is good are sparse in all this. Fox grid is good for making dense grids. Ah, okay. I I for making dense grids. Ah, okay. I I for making dense grids. Ah, okay. I I did did did kind of assume that after I saw a few of kind of assume that after I saw a few of kind of assume that after I saw a few of the errors. So, in this case, uh the the errors. So, in this case, uh the the errors. So, in this case, uh the grid is voxalized, but you'll you're grid is voxalized, but you'll you're grid is voxalized, but you'll you're still back in time. You'll you'll make still back in time. You'll you'll make still back in time. You'll you'll make it here soon enough. it here soon enough. it here soon enough. Let's see. So we got that. Let's see. So we got that. Let's see. So we got that. So again, the divergence is that all wait a minute. I all wait a minute. I all wait a minute. I can I just can I just can I just I have a material here and take a look I have a material here and take a look I have a material here and take a look at the attributes as a volume.

It's cool to see cuz yeah, added it." It's cool to see cuz yeah, added it." It's cool to see cuz yeah, joining bundles like again bundles joining bundles like again bundles joining bundles like again bundles depending on like my understanding of depending on like my understanding of depending on like my understanding of their implementation may be the most their implementation may be the most their implementation may be the most overpowered thing that we'll be getting overpowered thing that we'll be getting overpowered thing that we'll be getting in Geonodes going forward, at least for in Geonodes going forward, at least for in Geonodes going forward, at least for general management of stuff, general management of stuff, general management of stuff, especially with simulations. But yes, especially with simulations. But yes, especially with simulations. But yes, this will be quite nice for doing that. this will be quite nice for doing that. this will be quite nice for doing that. But that's uh like the simulation stuff But that's uh like the simulation stuff But that's uh like the simulation stuff is in the future. is in the future. is in the future. So if there is a color So if there is a color So if there is a color like vector is not like how do we access like vector is not like how do we access like vector is not like how do we access grid info? I know I have a feeling it's grid info? I know I have a feeling it's grid info? I know I have a feeling it's possible beyond just color. possible beyond just color. possible beyond just color. Okay. So, let's go and store named grid. Okay. So, let's go and store named grid. Okay. So, let's go and store named grid. And we'll make this one color. And we'll make this one color. And we'll make this one color. Make that one a Oh. Oh, we have our Make that one a Oh. Oh, we have our Make that one a Oh. Oh, we have our vectors. Okay, no biggie. Um, vectors. Okay, no biggie.

Okay, my gut was correct. works. Okay, my gut was correct. Just name it color and it will appear. Just name it color and it will appear. Just name it color and it will appear. Cool. Cool. Nice. and negatives are showing up as I and negatives are showing up as I and negatives are showing up as I expected. So, let's go to the shader expected. So, let's go to the shader expected.

Um, well, I guess I'll go and normalize. Um, well, I guess I'll go and normalize. Um, well, I guess I'll go and normalize. [Music] [Music] [Music] Okay. So, I just didn't have the Okay. So, I just didn't have the Okay. So, I just didn't have the emission strength on, which does sound emission strength on, which does sound emission strength on, which does sound like me, but it it I think there's a like me, but it it I think there's a like me, but it it I think there's a little bit more going on here little bit more going on here little bit more going on here cuz uh that should not occur. cuz uh that should not occur. cuz uh that should not occur. No, there there there's some issues No, there there there's some issues No, there there there's some issues going on. going on. going on. So, it's at least not entirely my fault. So, it's at least not entirely my fault. So, it's at least not entirely my fault. Or maybe just the data I'm sampling is Or maybe just the data I'm sampling is Or maybe just the data I'm sampling is just so out of whack that uh it just has just so out of whack that uh it just has just so out of whack that uh it just has an aneurysm. [Music] [Music] [Music] I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Let's also abs this uh absolute then scale. The new square nodes are then scale. The new square nodes are then scale. The new square nodes are growing on me even though they do take growing on me even though they do take growing on me even though they do take up a little bit more space. Mhm. Quite quirky. Quite quirky. Quite quirky. But anyway, um But anyway, um But anyway, um let's just have that one as ah. let's just have that one as ah. let's just have that one as ah. So, let's go. Oh, wait.

Ah, that's probably what happened. Ah, that's probably what happened. Okay, because again, these are like Okay, because again, these are like Okay, because again, these are like instances. So, this would be like get instances. So, this would be like get instances. So, this would be like get instance and it would remove it from the instance and it would remove it from the instance and it would remove it from the original so that there wouldn't be a original so that there wouldn't be a original so that there wouldn't be a copy. I think I might be possibly copy. I think I might be possibly copy. I think I might be possibly beginning to understand beginning to understand beginning to understand what is occurring at this time.

[Music] [Music] [Music] most intriguing. most intriguing. most intriguing. And also these can be sparse volumes And also these can be sparse volumes And also these can be sparse volumes which Oh, that's why the devs were using which Oh, that's why the devs were using which Oh, that's why the devs were using these as colliders these as colliders these as colliders because we can in theory use these for because we can in theory use these for because we can in theory use these for well I could try that right now. Wait a well I could try that right now. Wait a well I could try that right now. Wait a gosh darn second. Let me save this in gosh darn second. Let me save this in gosh darn second. Let me save this in its current state so that I don't lose its current state so that I don't lose its current state so that I don't lose such valuable progress. such valuable progress. such valuable progress. So, okay, this is going to be weird if So, okay, this is going to be weird if So, okay, this is going to be weird if it works, but bear with me. Bear with it works, but bear with me. Bear with it works, but bear with me. Bear with me. I'm going to have a new thing right me. I'm going to have a new thing right me. I'm going to have a new thing right here here here to SDF to SDF grid. to SDF grid. to SDF grid. So, if we do this, this should turn this So, if we do this, this should turn this So, if we do this, this should turn this into a grid. into a grid. into a grid. And then uh volume I can't spell for the life of me today. I can't spell for the life of me today. I can't spell for the life of me today. That's nothing new. So SDF grid. So we That's nothing new. So SDF grid. So we That's nothing new. So SDF grid. So we need to store nope. Store named grid. So need to store nope. Store named grid. So need to store nope. Store named grid. So there are no volumes here. So we need to there are no volumes here. So we need to there are no volumes here. So we need to make a volume kind of. This will just be make a volume kind of. This will just be make a volume kind of. This will just be a density. And then we need another one for the And then we need another one for the And then we need another one for the normal. Wait a minute. We can use the Wait a minute. We can use the Wait a minute. We can use the mesh. mesh. mesh. Oh no. Uh volume Oh no. Uh volume Oh no. Uh volume sample sample sample gradient. gradient. gradient. Will that give us the normal uh The gradients uh The gradients uh The gradients direction in magnitude of the change in direction in magnitude of the change in direction in magnitude of the change in values values values divergence is that so probably not but divergence is that so probably not but divergence is that so probably not but maybe circulation of a direction. So this I circulation of a direction. So this I circulation of a direction. So this I think is my best shot. think is my best shot. think is my best shot. Um Um Um but hey, here's hoping. So this will be but hey, here's hoping. So this will be but hey, here's hoping. So this will be normal. normal. normal. normal. normal. normal. So we have that and then if we have So we have that and then if we have So we have that and then if we have let's say a ton of points around in the let's say a ton of points around in the let's say a ton of points around in the scene scene scene random value if I can get the hang of random value if I can get the hang of random value if I can get the hang of this then I can create so many this then I can create so many this then I can create so many possibly interesting things potentially possibly interesting things potentially possibly interesting things potentially SDF SDF SDF um collision. um collision. um collision. So if I do this and then I sample So if I do this and then I sample So if I do this and then I sample uh uh uh sample grid, sample grid, sample grid, we do this and then we get the said we do this and then we get the said we do this and then we get the said grid. We might not even need that. grid. We might not even need that. grid. We might not even need that. This is probably a terrible, horrible, This is probably a terrible, horrible, This is probably a terrible, horrible, absolutely atrocious idea, absolutely atrocious idea, absolutely atrocious idea, but it might work. 90 oh 9.4 24 milliseconds already. That 90 oh 9.4 24 milliseconds already. That 90 oh 9.4 24 milliseconds already. That is uh not a good sign. is uh not a good sign. is uh not a good sign. If Oh, it's Yeah, it's mainly just If Oh, it's Yeah, it's mainly just If Oh, it's Yeah, it's mainly just because of that. Okay, so with that, it because of that. Okay, so with that, it because of that. Okay, so with that, it should should should be moving the points out of the way. So, if I were to throw these in a sim zone, if I were to throw these in a sim zone, if I were to throw these in a sim zone, in theory, in theory, in theory, and if I were to bake the grids, that and if I were to bake the grids, that and if I were to bake the grids, that might work as well. might work as well. might work as well. Uh, so let's have this and then also Uh, so let's have this and then also Uh, so let's have this and then also have a velocity step. These are custom have a velocity step. These are custom have a velocity step. These are custom node groups I made. Make stuff like this node groups I made. Make stuff like this node groups I made. Make stuff like this easier to do. easier to do. easier to do. Go. We plug that into there. We plug Go. We plug that into there. We plug Go. We plug that into there. We plug that into there. Take a look at the that into there. Take a look at the that into there. Take a look at the outputs. So, in theory, outputs. So, in theory, outputs. So, in theory, just these should do collision. just these should do collision. just these should do collision. They're doing collision. Oh my gosh. They're doing collision. Oh my gosh. They're doing collision. Oh my gosh. Maybe not the best collision cuz I Maybe not the best collision cuz I Maybe not the best collision cuz I assume that this might not be normalized assume that this might not be normalized assume that this might not be normalized properly properly properly though in this case. Let's uh just get though in this case. Let's uh just get though in this case. Let's uh just get you. Even though No, it should be you. Even though No, it should be you. Even though No, it should be normalized either way because that's how normalized either way because that's how normalized either way because that's how I set it. Nope. Wait a minute. Did I I set it. Nope. Wait a minute. Did I I set it. Nope. Wait a minute. Did I make it so that the normal was not make it so that the normal was not make it so that the normal was not normalized in here? normalized in here? normalized in here? It's not. It's not. It's not. That is a safeguard I should have put in That is a safeguard I should have put in That is a safeguard I should have put in anyway. Well, uh yeah, no, it's fine. anyway. Well, uh yeah, no, it's fine. anyway. Well, uh yeah, no, it's fine. So, right now with just a few nodes, uh So, right now with just a few nodes, uh So, right now with just a few nodes, uh let me join the original geo. let me join the original geo. let me join the original geo. Uh join geometry. Uh join geometry. Uh join geometry. We can see that a volume is indeed being We can see that a volume is indeed being We can see that a volume is indeed being Oh, it's not coarse enough. So, let's do this and then run a prune. No, it's an SDF grid, so it can't be too No, it's an SDF grid, so it can't be too No, it's an SDF grid, so it can't be too pruned. Is this live or pre-recorded? pruned.

[Music] [Music] [Music] Sir, you are hacking a vection. Lol. Sir, you are hacking a vection. Lol. Sir, you are hacking a vection. Lol. This will be easier when that lands. This will be easier when that lands. This will be easier when that lands. Yes, to the person in the past, yes, I Yes, to the person in the past, yes, I Yes, to the person in the past, yes, I am hacking it completely. am hacking it completely. am hacking it completely. Totally horrible idea. Um, but again, I Totally horrible idea. Um, but again, I Totally horrible idea. Um, but again, I I know I can do it. I just need to I know I can do it. I just need to I know I can do it. I just need to People have done invection in the past. People have done invection in the past. People have done invection in the past. I just don't have that in my memory at I just don't have that in my memory at I just don't have that in my memory at the moment. So now if I do this, they the moment. So now if I do this, they the moment. So now if I do this, they will sit on top because I took the will sit on top because I took the will sit on top because I took the radius into account. So we don't even radius into account. So we don't even radius into account. So we don't even need U or U or U. All we need is U and need U or U or U. All we need is U and need U or U or U. All we need is U and U. So U. So U. So grid gradient. Maybe this should be grid grid gradient. Maybe this should be grid grid gradient. Maybe this should be grid normal or I'm assuming this is like normal or I'm assuming this is like normal or I'm assuming this is like using OP open BDB terminology. So that's using OP open BDB terminology. So that's using OP open BDB terminology. So that's probably the way it's supposed to be probably the way it's supposed to be probably the way it's supposed to be referred to. referred to. referred to. Cool. Cool. Cool. How about that? How about that? How about that? You love to see it. Oh, just a few. You love to see it. Oh, just a few. You love to see it. Oh, just a few. Yeah. No, that is surprisingly okay. Yeah. No, that is surprisingly okay. Yeah. No, that is surprisingly okay. That was surprisingly easy. So, if you That was surprisingly easy. So, if you That was surprisingly easy. So, if you treat grids treat grids treat grids Oh, let me also put that uh right. If Oh, let me also put that uh right. If Oh, let me also put that uh right. If you treat grids like instances or you treat grids like instances or you treat grids like instances or layers, it makes a lot more sense. So, layers, it makes a lot more sense. So, layers, it makes a lot more sense. So, let me go and get you place this right let me go and get you place this right let me go and get you place this right here. So, this will be a nice floor. here. So, this will be a nice floor. here. So, this will be a nice floor. Oh, would you look at that? though we Oh, would you look at that? though we Oh, would you look at that? though we can see that. Uh oh, wait. can see that. Uh oh, wait. can see that. Uh oh, wait. 55 milliseconds. Oh my gosh. 55 milliseconds. Oh my gosh. 55 milliseconds. Oh my gosh. Wait, what is causing 55 milliseconds? Wait, what is causing 55 milliseconds? Wait, what is causing 55 milliseconds? Is it because of the prune? I would imagine. Oh, yeah. No, it's it's the prune. if I Well, no, of course rotating won't if I Well, no, of course rotating won't if I Well, no, of course rotating won't do um anything do um anything do um anything because of stuff. So, I need to go into because of stuff. So, I need to go into because of stuff. So, I need to go into edit mode to do that. But yes, getting edit mode to do that. But yes, getting edit mode to do that. But yes, getting Okay, so if we do that and then play it Okay, so if we do that and then play it Okay, so if we do that and then play it again and then we can move this around. again and then we can move this around. again and then we can move this around. That is That is That is pretty good, got to say. Well, why is that causing it to lag? Oh, Well, why is that causing it to lag? Oh, Well, why is that causing it to lag? Oh, wait. That's because of you. wait. That's because of you. wait. That's because of you. Ah, that explains a lot. Ah, that explains a lot. Ah, that explains a lot. Okay, so let's turn the bounce down to Okay, so let's turn the bounce down to Okay, so let's turn the bounce down to zero. They'll just fall and not do zero. They'll just fall and not do zero. They'll just fall and not do anything. If we turn it up all the way, anything. If we turn it up all the way, anything. If we turn it up all the way, they will just bounce into infinity. they will just bounce into infinity. they will just bounce into infinity. Well, almost infinity because, well, my Well, almost infinity because, well, my Well, almost infinity because, well, my implementation of friction and all that implementation of friction and all that implementation of friction and all that was perfect. No problems whatsoever. was perfect. No problems whatsoever. was perfect. No problems whatsoever. Yeah. Uh-oh. Yeah. Uh-oh. Yeah. Uh-oh. Oh, those fell because they're literally Oh, those fell because they're literally Oh, those fell because they're literally underneath the uh Yeah, there we go. You underneath the uh Yeah, there we go. You underneath the uh Yeah, there we go. You love to see it. And if I added in love to see it. And if I added in love to see it. And if I added in particle self collisions, well, then particle self collisions, well, then particle self collisions, well, then that would work. In theory, In theory, In theory, I could do particle self collisions I could do particle self collisions I could do particle self collisions because I can turn the volumes that the because I can turn the volumes that the because I can turn the volumes that the particles themselves into a grid. H particles themselves into a grid. H particles themselves into a grid. H um um um that might be a horrible idea, but let's that might be a horrible idea, but let's that might be a horrible idea, but let's skip to go. Okay, so points to SDF grid. This is the worst idea that I've had, This is the worst idea that I've had, This is the worst idea that I've had, but it will work. Or wait, do SDF grids? It'll be fine. Let me save this because It'll be fine. Let me save this because It'll be fine. Let me save this because I do not anticipate that it will be fine I do not anticipate that it will be fine I do not anticipate that it will be fine here. here. here. [Music] [Music] [Music] Well, that's just about as good as I Well, that's just about as good as I Well, that's just about as good as I could have expected. could have expected. could have expected. Yeah. And the radius we need to make Yeah. And the radius we need to make Yeah. And the radius we need to make sure that's the actual radius. sure that's the actual radius. sure that's the actual radius. [Music] Oh, almost working. [Music] [Music] [Music] Or wait a minute, because it's a radius, Or wait a minute, because it's a radius, Or wait a minute, because it's a radius, but that's as an SDF grid. I need to see but that's as an SDF grid. I need to see but that's as an SDF grid. I need to see the SDF grid. the SDF grid. the SDF grid. Crap. Crap. Crap. [Music] [Music] [Music] Okay. Voxil side. Oh, this is actually Okay. Voxil side. Oh, this is actually Okay. Voxil side. Oh, this is actually very potentially very very bad. very potentially very very bad. very potentially very very bad. I'd have to because once these get too I'd have to because once these get too I'd have to because once these get too big, big, big, it'll get really really bad really it'll get really really bad really it'll get really really bad really really fast. really fast. really fast. But we can if we look closely here and But we can if we look closely here and But we can if we look closely here and see that that part is working. So this see that that part is working. So this see that that part is working. So this would have to be very low for it to would have to be very low for it to would have to be very low for it to actually function. actually function. actually function. But we can see that these their But we can see that these their But we can see that these their collision parts are there. This is a collision parts are there. This is a collision parts are there. This is a very very bad idea. Oh no, they're colliding with Oh no, they're colliding with Oh no, they're colliding with themselves. What am I talking about? Of course they're doing that. They're Of course they're doing that. They're Of course they're doing that. They're colliding with their own geo. colliding with their own geo. colliding with their own geo. So, how could I possibly make it so that So, how could I possibly make it so that So, how could I possibly make it so that they ignore themselves? they ignore themselves? they ignore themselves? Well, I could always No, that wouldn't Well, I could always No, that wouldn't Well, I could always No, that wouldn't work either. work either. work either. Herm, [Music] [Music] [Music] how could I make that actually work? how could I make that actually work? how could I make that actually work? [Music] [Music] [Music] Maybe Maybe Maybe if the gradient is less than a certain if the gradient is less than a certain if the gradient is less than a certain amount, then don't do anything amount, then don't do anything amount, then don't do anything potentially. potentially. potentially. Crap. Crap. Crap. This can completely lag and freeze at This can completely lag and freeze at This can completely lag and freeze at any moment. Just to let you all know. any moment. Just to let you all know. any moment. Just to let you all know. Let me go and uh multiply this by like Let me go and uh multiply this by like Let me go and uh multiply this by like 0.1 so that we can see what's actually 0.1 so that we can see what's actually 0.1 so that we can see what's actually going to occur here. So here, yeah, going to occur here. So here, yeah, going to occur here. So here, yeah, they are colliding, but yeah, the the they are colliding, but yeah, the the they are colliding, but yeah, the the previous point still stands. previous point still stands. previous point still stands. So I could Oh, wait. I could make it so So I could Oh, wait. I could make it so So I could Oh, wait. I could make it so that they're just attracted to that they're just attracted to that they're just attracted to Yeah. No, I could do that. Okay, so Yeah. No, I could do that. Okay, so Yeah. No, I could do that. Okay, so let's go and play around with this. So let's go and play around with this. So let's go and play around with this. So we'll put the sign distance into there, we'll put the sign distance into there, we'll put the sign distance into there, but instead we're going to set this to but instead we're going to set this to but instead we're going to set this to be negative. So they're attracted to be negative. So they're attracted to be negative. So they're attracted to each other instead of repulsed. I thought that would have been a little I thought that would have been a little I thought that would have been a little bit better. Or actually, wait, let's just Oh, wait. Yeah, no, we just need to set Oh, wait. Yeah, no, we just need to set Oh, wait. Yeah, no, we just need to set velocity. velocity. velocity. Okay, so we'll ignore collision spread. Okay, so we'll ignore collision spread. Okay, so we'll ignore collision spread. Oo, that's nice. Uh, we'll ignore that Oo, that's nice. Uh, we'll ignore that Oo, that's nice. Uh, we'll ignore that for now. And we're just going to get the for now. And we're just going to get the for now. And we're just going to get the normal normal normal scale it by this and then plug it in and scale it by this and then plug it in and scale it by this and then plug it in and th this will be our force. So in theory th this will be our force. So in theory th this will be our force. So in theory we remove you as well. we remove you as well. we remove you as well. Set this to be negative. No, but this Set this to be negative. No, but this Set this to be negative. No, but this won't work either. This can't work won't work either. This can't work won't work either. This can't work because of the because of the because of the radius issue. All of them will be inside radius issue. All of them will be inside radius issue. All of them will be inside their own radi and they can't sample any their own radi and they can't sample any their own radi and they can't sample any other ones. So completely ignored what I other ones. So completely ignored what I other ones. So completely ignored what I just said. Yeah. No, this this can't just said. Yeah. No, this this can't just said. Yeah. No, this this can't work. work. work. Uh okay. So let's just ignore that and Uh okay. So let's just ignore that and Uh okay. So let's just ignore that and go back to square one, which wasn't a go back to square one, which wasn't a go back to square one, which wasn't a bad square to be on if if I had to bad square to be on if if I had to bad square to be on if if I had to guess. Not a bad square, but just a guess. Not a bad square, but just a guess. Not a bad square, but just a square. There we go. So back to here. We square. There we go. So back to here. We square. There we go. So back to here. We have the volumes. They're colliding. So have the volumes. They're colliding. So have the volumes. They're colliding. So if we wanted actual collisions to if we wanted actual collisions to if we wanted actual collisions to happen, we would basically have to run a happen, we would basically have to run a happen, we would basically have to run a parallel parallel parallel like fluid simulation. So I would have like fluid simulation. So I would have like fluid simulation. So I would have to add vect. But you know, yeah. So yeah, volumes can be used for yeah. So yeah, volumes can be used for yeah. So yeah, volumes can be used for collisions, which SDFs are used for collisions, which SDFs are used for collisions, which SDFs are used for collisions in various circumstances. collisions in various circumstances. collisions in various circumstances. Like I believe Unreal Engine's Lumen Like I believe Unreal Engine's Lumen Like I believe Unreal Engine's Lumen uses it for like light stuff. I would uses it for like light stuff. I would uses it for like light stuff. I would have to double check on that. But stuff have to double check on that. But stuff have to double check on that. But stuff like uh ray marching for like um like uh ray marching for like um like uh ray marching for like um radiance cascades and stuff like that, radiance cascades and stuff like that, radiance cascades and stuff like that, SDFs are very very useful. So having SDFs are very very useful. So having SDFs are very very useful. So having kind of a native SDF thingy mob hopper kind of a native SDF thingy mob hopper kind of a native SDF thingy mob hopper is good. And also my SDF collision asset is good. And also my SDF collision asset is good. And also my SDF collision asset works even though grids did not exist works even though grids did not exist works even though grids did not exist when I made it. So I was thinking ahead. when I made it. So I was thinking ahead. when I made it. So I was thinking ahead. The math checks out. The math checks out. The math checks out. Um yeah um um um bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth with active voxil service. with active voxil service. with active voxil service. Let's change that to one. Let's change that to one. Let's change that to one. [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm not sure what that does. I'm not sure what that does. I'm not sure what that does. It looks like at least having more than one at least having more than one at least having more than one is better. is better. is better. I would assume if this is sparse, which I would assume if this is sparse, which I would assume if this is sparse, which I assume it is by default. I assume it is by default. I assume it is by default. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, it does that. And we only care about the it does that. And we only care about the it does that. And we only care about the negative part of the SDF negative part of the SDF negative part of the SDF for collisions, even though the positive for collisions, even though the positive for collisions, even though the positive one could be used in other situations. one could be used in other situations. one could be used in other situations. [Music] [Music] [Music] But yes, this is But yes, this is But yes, this is quite intriguing, quite intriguing, quite intriguing, I want to say. I want to say. I want to say. Okay. Um Okay. Um Okay. Um la dah. la dah. la dah. That's that. Also, let's go and That's that. Also, let's go and That's that. Also, let's go and randomize the um the points radi randomize the um the points radi randomize the um the points radi just so that we can see that the just so that we can see that the just so that we can see that the different radi different radi different radi Ohoh. Ohoh. Ohoh. Why would that Oh, wait. I think I know Why would that Oh, wait. I think I know Why would that Oh, wait. I think I know why that's happening. We can see it why that's happening. We can see it why that's happening. We can see it works unless the radius is too big, works unless the radius is too big, works unless the radius is too big, which I assume is because it's colliding which I assume is because it's colliding which I assume is because it's colliding with multiple surfaces at the same time. with multiple surfaces at the same time. with multiple surfaces at the same time. Substeps would fix that. or it's just Substeps would fix that. or it's just Substeps would fix that. or it's just like trying to fall through the floor, like trying to fall through the floor, like trying to fall through the floor, which in this case that's because which in this case that's because which in this case that's because they're just moving way too fast. Well, they're just moving way too fast. Well, they're just moving way too fast. Well, if I did that, none uh none should fall if I did that, none uh none should fall if I did that, none uh none should fall through the floor. But we can see it's through the floor. But we can see it's through the floor. But we can see it's still still having a few issues. Maybe still still having a few issues. Maybe still still having a few issues. Maybe they're like colliding with that and it they're like colliding with that and it they're like colliding with that and it has trouble. has trouble. has trouble. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Plenty of room for error, Plenty of room for error, Plenty of room for error, but we'll deal with that when it gets but we'll deal with that when it gets but we'll deal with that when it gets there. there. there. Or maybe just the SDF is not quite as Or maybe just the SDF is not quite as Or maybe just the SDF is not quite as accurate as I think because this has a accurate as I think because this has a accurate as I think because this has a very low margin for error. very low margin for error. very low margin for error. No, that wouldn't make sense. No, that wouldn't make sense. No, that wouldn't make sense. But yeah, we got that. Let's go and make But yeah, we got that. Let's go and make But yeah, we got that. Let's go and make this lean over so that we can see them this lean over so that we can see them this lean over so that we can see them all fall. We're at 46 minutes. The time all fall. We're at 46 minutes. The time all fall. We're at 46 minutes. The time just flew by. just flew by. just flew by. But actually, yeah, why is that But actually, yeah, why is that But actually, yeah, why is that happening right there? happening right there? happening right there? Is it treating the radius like a Is it treating the radius like a Is it treating the radius like a diameter diameter diameter or no? No. I I don't know why it's kind of No. I I don't know why it's kind of No. I I don't know why it's kind of hovering there. hovering there. hovering there. What happens if the normals were What happens if the normals were What happens if the normals were inverted? That could be bad. inverted? That could be bad. inverted? That could be bad. What does this deal with high poly What does this deal with high poly What does this deal with high poly meshes? Because with just a few cubes, meshes? Because with just a few cubes, meshes? Because with just a few cubes, this is very high poly. this is very high poly. this is very high poly. So, if I were to subdivide it a lot, So, if I were to subdivide it a lot, So, if I were to subdivide it a lot, let's see how bad it can get. let's see how bad it can get. let's see how bad it can get. [Music] [Music] [Music] How many polygons is this? How many polygons is this? How many polygons is this? Far as I've seen, performance on this Far as I've seen, performance on this Far as I've seen, performance on this has been quite good. Okay, so that is has been quite good. Okay, so that is has been quite good. Okay, so that is 100,000. [Music] [Music] [Music] Then that's like that. Okay, so it does Then that's like that. Okay, so it does Then that's like that. Okay, so it does scale up quite a bit. scale up quite a bit. scale up quite a bit. That is to be expected. Okay. That is to be expected. Okay. That is to be expected. Okay. I guess it's because yeah, no, that that I guess it's because yeah, no, that that I guess it's because yeah, no, that that is completely expected. It's like doing is completely expected. It's like doing is completely expected. It's like doing it for points on all this. So maybe in it for points on all this. So maybe in it for points on all this. So maybe in these cases having just regular um these cases having just regular um these cases having just regular um sampling for the SDF would be good, but sampling for the SDF would be good, but sampling for the SDF would be good, but there is a point when like there's a there is a point when like there's a there is a point when like there's a ratio of particles where calculating the ratio of particles where calculating the ratio of particles where calculating the SDF is better than the alternative. So, SDF is better than the alternative. So, SDF is better than the alternative. So, if I had like a bajillion points, if I had like a bajillion points, if I had like a bajillion points, let me go and just uh undo some of the let me go and just uh undo some of the let me go and just uh undo some of the damage I did to this. damage I did to this. damage I did to this. It would be faster to sample the grid It would be faster to sample the grid It would be faster to sample the grid than that. So, let's go and do 10,000 than that. So, let's go and do 10,000 than that. So, let's go and do 10,000 particles. That'll be fine. Oh, yeah. particles. That'll be fine. Oh, yeah. particles. That'll be fine. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Well, no, that's 10,000 particles. Let's Well, no, that's 10,000 particles. Let's Well, no, that's 10,000 particles. Let's go 100,000. go 100,000. go 100,000. 100,000 particles. It's fine. Yeah, look 100,000 particles. It's fine. Yeah, look 100,000 particles. It's fine. Yeah, look at that. That's good. Uh, actually, let's make That's good. Uh, actually, let's make That's good. Uh, actually, let's make sure that's an actual Yeah, know that's sure that's an actual Yeah, know that's sure that's an actual Yeah, know that's correct. So, 100,000 particles just correct. So, 100,000 particles just correct. So, 100,000 particles just fine. 1 million. This will lag. Hey, 1 fine. 1 million. This will lag. Hey, 1 fine. 1 million. This will lag. Hey, 1 million particles. million particles. million particles. That's actually not bad. All running on the CPU just because we All running on the CPU just because we All running on the CPU just because we can go and sample the uh mesh grid. can go and sample the uh mesh grid. can go and sample the uh mesh grid. Let's go and add in some more bounce and Let's go and add in some more bounce and Let's go and add in some more bounce and a little bit of friction. Maybe a little bit of friction. Maybe a little bit of friction. Maybe randomize it a bit. One bajillion. What if I made it a One bajillion. What if I made it a One bajillion. What if I made it a billion particles? billion particles? billion particles? So, if I Let's do a speed comparison So, if I Let's do a speed comparison So, if I Let's do a speed comparison test. So, SDF. test. So, SDF. test. So, SDF. Uh, no. EF. Uh, no. EF. Uh, no. EF. So, if I were to do this, prepare So, if I were to do this, prepare So, if I were to do this, prepare yourselves. yourselves. yourselves. This will be horrendously slow. There we go. See, we're getting a nice There we go. See, we're getting a nice There we go. See, we're getting a nice crisp three frames per second. So, crisp three frames per second. So, crisp three frames per second. So, that's considerably better. Almost like a five times speed Almost like a five times speed Almost like a five times speed improvement around that improvement around that improvement around that or four. Yeah, it's because it's not doing a BBH Yeah, it's because it's not doing a BBH Yeah, it's because it's not doing a BBH on this again and again and again. on this again and again and again. on this again and again and again. It's already been converted to a grid It's already been converted to a grid It's already been converted to a grid and then all that happens. And we could and then all that happens. And we could and then all that happens. And we could make the grid even more sparse which make the grid even more sparse which make the grid even more sparse which will affect um actually no that's will affect um actually no that's will affect um actually no that's actually not affecting performance all actually not affecting performance all actually not affecting performance all too much. Not bad. Not bad. And also too much. Not bad. Not bad. And also too much. Not bad. Not bad. And also this is recalculating every single frame this is recalculating every single frame this is recalculating every single frame and everything. and everything. and everything. So So So yeah, not bad. yeah, not bad. yeah, not bad. Let's throw this onto the bounce so that Let's throw this onto the bounce so that Let's throw this onto the bounce so that we have a random there. Let's set to be we have a random there. Let's set to be we have a random there. Let's set to be between 0.5 and 0.1. Yeah, quite a few. But let's make the Yeah, quite a few. But let's make the Yeah, quite a few. But let's make the radius significantly smaller so that we radius significantly smaller so that we radius significantly smaller so that we can see all the Oh, that's a lot of can see all the Oh, that's a lot of can see all the Oh, that's a lot of that's more particles than I thought. that's more particles than I thought. that's more particles than I thought. [Music] [Music] [Music] You love to see it. You love to see it. You love to see it. Attributes. Let's have some uh just, you Attributes. Let's have some uh just, you Attributes. Let's have some uh just, you know, some general velocity going on. know, some general velocity going on. know, some general velocity going on. Let's have this be noise texture. And Let's have this be noise texture. And Let's have this be noise texture. And this is Oh, right. I made this with this is Oh, right. I made this with this is Oh, right. I made this with delta time in mind. Man, node groups are delta time in mind. Man, node groups are delta time in mind. Man, node groups are amazing. Right there. So many particles the bit Right there. So many particles the bit Right there. So many particles the bit rate probably can't even keep up with rate probably can't even keep up with rate probably can't even keep up with it. But for like uh SDF or for self it. But for like uh SDF or for self it. But for like uh SDF or for self collisions, you know, every collisions, you know, every collisions, you know, every particle-based water sim uh uses like a particle-based water sim uh uses like a particle-based water sim uh uses like a a volume simulation on top of that. So a volume simulation on top of that. So a volume simulation on top of that. So once that happens, I can drive particles once that happens, I can drive particles once that happens, I can drive particles with sim and that'll be quite cool. with sim and that'll be quite cool. with sim and that'll be quite cool. We can see that the voxil uh grid is a We can see that the voxil uh grid is a We can see that the voxil uh grid is a little bit iffy there. So I can probably little bit iffy there. So I can probably little bit iffy there. So I can probably just turn up the resolution. just turn up the resolution. just turn up the resolution. We can see here that performance does We can see here that performance does We can see here that performance does not is about the same. I think sampling not is about the same. I think sampling not is about the same. I think sampling these volumes, even if they're not these volumes, even if they're not these volumes, even if they're not sparse, is uh sparse, is uh sparse, is uh quite a bit uh rather efficient. quite a bit uh rather efficient. quite a bit uh rather efficient. Yeah, it just has problems with sharp Yeah, it just has problems with sharp Yeah, it just has problems with sharp corners, which is to be expected though. corners, which is to be expected though. corners, which is to be expected though. If we did nearest neighbor, that make it If we did nearest neighbor, that make it If we did nearest neighbor, that make it faster. Ah, no. Because that is sampling faster. Ah, no. Because that is sampling faster. Ah, no. Because that is sampling just the actual nearest thing. But try just the actual nearest thing. But try just the actual nearest thing. But try linear is the way to go. Let's turn on cavity Let's turn on cavity Let's turn on cavity world. Turn it up. There we go. Now we world. Turn it up. There we go. Now we world. Turn it up. There we go. Now we can see just how dense all these can see just how dense all these can see just how dense all these particles are. What if I try 10 million? particles are. What if I try 10 million? particles are. What if I try 10 million? Well, it was nice knowing you guys. I'll Well, it was nice knowing you guys. I'll Well, it was nice knowing you guys. I'll see you later. Takes 31 milliseconds just to generate Takes 31 milliseconds just to generate Takes 31 milliseconds just to generate that many. that many. that many. 2,500 milliseconds. Okay. 2,500 milliseconds. Okay. 2,500 milliseconds. Okay. All right. Let's uh let's advance one All right. Let's uh let's advance one All right. Let's uh let's advance one frame. See how long it takes. So, it frame. See how long it takes. So, it frame. See how long it takes. So, it takes around takes around takes around 3 seconds per frame for 10 million 3 seconds per frame for 10 million 3 seconds per frame for 10 million particles. particles. particles. For Blender standards, For Blender standards, For Blender standards, not bad. Well, I guess for just CPU not bad. Well, I guess for just CPU not bad. Well, I guess for just CPU standards, not bad. standards, not bad. standards, not bad. So, this is it with mesh collisions. 10 So, this is it with mesh collisions. 10 So, this is it with mesh collisions. 10 million of them running at a round one million of them running at a round one million of them running at a round one frame per 3 seconds. frame per 3 seconds. frame per 3 seconds. Now, if this were on the GPU, you would Now, if this were on the GPU, you would Now, if this were on the GPU, you would expect this you would like this would be expect this you would like this would be expect this you would like this would be real time like in Touch Designer and real time like in Touch Designer and real time like in Touch Designer and stuff like that, but that's because the stuff like that, but that's because the stuff like that, but that's because the GPU is specifically made for doing lots GPU is specifically made for doing lots GPU is specifically made for doing lots of little things in parallel. Although of little things in parallel. Although of little things in parallel. Although CPU again, I I forget how many cores I CPU again, I I forget how many cores I CPU again, I I forget how many cores I have on my thing, but this is doing I'm have on my thing, but this is doing I'm have on my thing, but this is doing I'm giving my CPU a very very hard time giving my CPU a very very hard time giving my CPU a very very hard time right now. So, I would not recommend right now. So, I would not recommend right now. So, I would not recommend doing this normally. So, let's go back doing this normally. So, let's go back doing this normally. So, let's go back to sanity to sanity to sanity and just have 1 million particles. and just have 1 million particles. and just have 1 million particles. It's pretty good. Let's also get the SDF It's pretty good. Let's also get the SDF It's pretty good. Let's also get the SDF mesh again because I just want to see mesh again because I just want to see mesh again because I just want to see how bad it can be. how bad it can be. how bad it can be. Oh, yeah. And there uh node groups are Oh, yeah. And there uh node groups are Oh, yeah. And there uh node groups are now packed. Love to see it. now packed. Love to see it. now packed. Love to see it. Normal. Uh wait, let's just connect this Normal. Uh wait, let's just connect this Normal. Uh wait, let's just connect this here and here as it was here and here as it was here and here as it was up here. Oh, performance isn't as bad as I Oh, performance isn't as bad as I Oh, performance isn't as bad as I thought it would be, thought it would be, thought it would be, but it's still quite a bit faster here. but it's still quite a bit faster here. but it's still quite a bit faster here. Yeah. Look at that. Let's go and rotate this a Look at that. Let's go and rotate this a Look at that. Let's go and rotate this a bit more so that we can just see it all. bit more so that we can just see it all. bit more so that we can just see it all. So, let me double check. So, let me double check. So, let me double check. Ah, a few of these are falling straight Ah, a few of these are falling straight Ah, a few of these are falling straight through. So, I probably either through. So, I probably either through. So, I probably either this grid gradient is not doing what I this grid gradient is not doing what I this grid gradient is not doing what I expect, which is kind of what I expect. expect, which is kind of what I expect. expect, which is kind of what I expect. [Music] [Music] [Music] I assume that I did something wrong I assume that I did something wrong I assume that I did something wrong here. Or wait. Oh, wait. Maybe this is here. Or wait. Oh, wait. Maybe this is here. Or wait. Oh, wait. Maybe this is it. Could have done that beforehand. and also after just to make sure. and also after just to make sure. and also after just to make sure. Ah, no. Okay, so I'm assuming this is Ah, no. Okay, so I'm assuming this is Ah, no. Okay, so I'm assuming this is incorrect incorrect incorrect is causing that to happen, but at the is causing that to happen, but at the is causing that to happen, but at the very least it's kind of doing stuff in very least it's kind of doing stuff in very least it's kind of doing stuff in some scenarios. some scenarios. some scenarios. The collisions seem to be fine unless The collisions seem to be fine unless The collisions seem to be fine unless they're moving quite fast. Yeah. Okay. Uh, that's good enough. So, Yeah. Okay. Uh, that's good enough. So, Yeah. Okay. Uh, that's good enough. So, let's go and bring it down to 10,000 let's go and bring it down to 10,000 let's go and bring it down to 10,000 particles. Or is that 1,000? That's particles. Or is that 1,000? That's particles. Or is that 1,000? That's 10,000. 10,000. 10,000. Isn't your computer on fire? Ah, because Isn't your computer on fire? Ah, because Isn't your computer on fire? Ah, because volumes volumes volumes Yeah, that works. Okay, let's go back to Yeah, that works. Okay, let's go back to Yeah, that works. Okay, let's go back to you. So, I do need to figure out you. So, I do need to figure out you. So, I do need to figure out adection though. All in all, the adection though. All in all, the adection though. All in all, the invection node will probably come along invection node will probably come along invection node will probably come along within the next couple of days, assuming within the next couple of days, assuming within the next couple of days, assuming it makes it into 5.0, which given how it makes it into 5.0, which given how it makes it into 5.0, which given how many nodes were approved, I think that's many nodes were approved, I think that's many nodes were approved, I think that's on the way. on the way. on the way. But yes, But yes, But yes, okay, okay, okay, I think that might be everything for I think that might be everything for I think that might be everything for today. So again, what I learned now is today. So again, what I learned now is today. So again, what I learned now is you need to treat these like each grid you need to treat these like each grid you need to treat these like each grid is its own thing. is its own thing. is its own thing. and multiple grids can be packed into a and multiple grids can be packed into a and multiple grids can be packed into a volume. volume. volume. So grids it it is a bit confusing to me. So grids it it is a bit confusing to me. So grids it it is a bit confusing to me. So grids are the volume data and you can So grids are the volume data and you can So grids are the volume data and you can pack multiple pack multiple pack multiple amounts of that data into one volume. amounts of that data into one volume. amounts of that data into one volume. But these grids can have different But these grids can have different But these grids can have different densities, different transforms, densities, different transforms, densities, different transforms, different orientations. different orientations. different orientations. So basically So basically So basically grids are almost like their own geometry grids are almost like their own geometry grids are almost like their own geometry type in the same that instances are type in the same that instances are type in the same that instances are maybe not quite not really but you can maybe not quite not really but you can maybe not quite not really but you can see my line of logic if I had oh right see my line of logic if I had oh right see my line of logic if I had oh right there is the annotate tool. I was like there is the annotate tool. I was like there is the annotate tool. I was like if I had my pen connected but no I could if I had my pen connected but no I could if I had my pen connected but no I could just use my mouse. So here is the main just use my mouse. So here is the main just use my mouse. So here is the main geometry line and then the grids are geometry line and then the grids are geometry line and then the grids are just like that. Just little sub things just like that. Just little sub things just like that. Just little sub things are attached kind of like a bundle I are attached kind of like a bundle I are attached kind of like a bundle I guess. guess. guess. And I guess lists will run in the same And I guess lists will run in the same And I guess lists will run in the same way where you can potentially pack lists way where you can potentially pack lists way where you can potentially pack lists into geometry lines. So you can just into geometry lines. So you can just into geometry lines. So you can just have a geometry with a ton of those have a geometry with a ton of those have a geometry with a ton of those packed into there. And I guess you can packed into there. And I guess you can packed into there. And I guess you can already do that with cons. No. already do that with cons. No. already do that with cons. No. No. I do not know why I'm talking about No. I do not know why I'm talking about No. I do not know why I'm talking about with that. with that. with that. though though though I did hear something about packing I did hear something about packing I did hear something about packing data into geometry bundles actually. Yeah, let's take a look at actually. Yeah, let's take a look at actually. Yeah, let's take a look at that. Let me take a look at the change that. Let me take a look at the change that. Let me take a look at the change log. There is a lot to go over today. Uh log. There is a lot to go over today. Uh log. There is a lot to go over today. Uh combine separate join bundle. combine separate join bundle. combine separate join bundle. Yes. And it allows overwriting existing Yes. And it allows overwriting existing Yes. And it allows overwriting existing values in a bundle. Oh, that's cool. values in a bundle. Oh, that's cool. values in a bundle. Oh, that's cool. Um, bundles are also available for Um, bundles are also available for Um, bundles are also available for shader nodes, which is good. There's shader nodes, which is good. There's shader nodes, which is good. There's closures. closures. closures. The viewer got an upgrade. All right, UV The viewer got an upgrade. All right, UV The viewer got an upgrade. All right, UV tangents, but I think I went over that. tangents, but I think I went over that. tangents, but I think I went over that. So, again, we finally have UV tangents. So, again, we finally have UV tangents. So, again, we finally have UV tangents. I remember it might have been a I remember it might have been a I remember it might have been a might have been like maybe over two might have been like maybe over two might have been like maybe over two years ago where I first showed my own UV years ago where I first showed my own UV years ago where I first showed my own UV tangent node because I have been using tangent node because I have been using tangent node because I have been using that for years. But now we have one that that for years. But now we have one that that for years. But now we have one that actually uses the proper uh MC Espace actually uses the proper uh MC Espace actually uses the proper uh MC Espace library. So I'll match the shader editor library. So I'll match the shader editor library. So I'll match the shader editor one to one. And there's also a fast mode one to one. And there's also a fast mode one to one. And there's also a fast mode which is four times as fast. which is four times as fast. which is four times as fast. Uh and there's an essentials library Uh and there's an essentials library Uh and there's an essentials library which which which um um um normals. Oh, there multiple smooth normals. Oh, there multiple smooth normals. Oh, there multiple smooth angles here. angles here. angles here. Why is that happening? Maybe it's some Why is that happening? Maybe it's some Why is that happening? Maybe it's some duplication stuff that's being worked duplication stuff that's being worked duplication stuff that's being worked on. on. on. Um, okay. So, there's generate. Oh, and Um, okay. So, there's generate. Oh, and Um, okay. So, there's generate. Oh, and there's dup. Why are there duplicates there's dup. Why are there duplicates there's dup. Why are there duplicates here? here? here? I only have one project saved with that. I only have one project saved with that. I only have one project saved with that. Maybe that's why there might be some Maybe that's why there might be some Maybe that's why there might be some duplication stuff happening. duplication stuff happening. duplication stuff happening. Um, let's see. There should be some Um, let's see. There should be some Um, let's see. There should be some new utilities in here if they're already new utilities in here if they're already new utilities in here if they're already a part of it. Ah, here. Yes, vector. All a part of it. Ah, here. Yes, vector. All a part of it. Ah, here. Yes, vector. All of these are node groups as we can see of these are node groups as we can see of these are node groups as we can see here. There's a lot of that kind of here. There's a lot of that kind of here. There's a lot of that kind of stuff. Tons of new node groups. stuff. Tons of new node groups. stuff. Tons of new node groups. Spherical. So, this turns cartisian into Spherical. So, this turns cartisian into Spherical. So, this turns cartisian into spherical coordinate coordinates and uh spherical coordinate coordinates and uh spherical coordinate coordinates and uh cylindrical coordinates. Do these also cylindrical coordinates. Do these also cylindrical coordinates. Do these also apply to the shader editor? But you apply to the shader editor? But you apply to the shader editor? But you could just copy them over. So, yeah, could just copy them over. So, yeah, could just copy them over. So, yeah, it's fine. Text. No, nothing there. Hash it's fine. Text. No, nothing there. Hash it's fine. Text. No, nothing there. Hash value. So yeah, nothing there. value. So yeah, nothing there. value. So yeah, nothing there.

I would need to but it's kind of cool. I would need to but it's kind of cool. I would need to use the divergence and all that to make use the divergence and all that to make use the divergence and all that to make that work. And also, this will work in that work. And also, this will work in that work. And also, this will work in two dimensions as well. two dimensions as well. two dimensions as well. Oh. Ah, yes we can do a one degree of Oh.

We can't do one with less than it has to have two voxels. Interesting. Interesting. We can't have a grid with Interesting. We can't have a grid with Interesting. We can't have a grid with less than or the volume cube cannot do less than or the volume cube cannot do less than or the volume cube cannot do one with just one, but I assume that we one with just one, but I assume that we one with just one, but I assume that we can create one that is can create one that is can create one that is that doesn't have that. I'm assuming that doesn't have that. I'm assuming that doesn't have that. I'm assuming that's a former limitation that no that's a former limitation that no that's a former limitation that no longer applies longer applies longer applies if I had to guess. if I had to guess. if I had to guess. The only way to make that is with volume The only way to make that is with volume The only way to make that is with volume cube. cube. cube. [Music] [Music] [Music] So So So [Music] [Music] [Music] h there is most definitely a workaround h there is most definitely a workaround h there is most definitely a workaround for that. Ah it's because of that right. Ah it's because of that right. Ah it's because of that right. So 2D I know Houdini again I haven't So 2D I know Houdini again I haven't So 2D I know Houdini again I haven't been in Houdini for a while and I should been in Houdini for a while and I should been in Houdini for a while and I should be in there but uh Houdini supports like be in there but uh Houdini supports like be in there but uh Houdini supports like two dimensional volumes two dimensional volumes two dimensional volumes and I think we can go and do that as and I think we can go and do that as and I think we can go and do that as well. well. well. But yeah know this will be this will be But yeah know this will be this will be But yeah know this will be this will be interesting. We'll be cooking up some interesting. We'll be cooking up some interesting. We'll be cooking up some new uh simulation stuff with this. new uh simulation stuff with this. new uh simulation stuff with this. Quite interesting. Quite interesting. Quite interesting. right here. We can just see the whatever right here. We can just see the whatever right here. We can just see the whatever this is going about. Let's also go and this is going about. Let's also go and this is going about. Let's also go and uh set shade smooth though. I still again if this was trial though. I still again if this was trial though. I still again if this was trial we can see that it really likes to we can see that it really likes to we can see that it really likes to disappear on us. disappear on us. disappear on us. Yeah. So, nearest nearest neighbor is Yeah. So, nearest nearest neighbor is Yeah. So, nearest nearest neighbor is okay. This is quite interesting. Let me go and get a nice camera set up Let me go and get a nice camera set up Let me go and get a nice camera set up here because I'll probably post this here because I'll probably post this here because I'll probably post this tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Make it look nice and fancy, you know, Make it look nice and fancy, you know, Make it look nice and fancy, you know, have a black background. have a black background. have a black background. Then have that as well. Then have that as well. Then have that as well. And then to make it actually look really And then to make it actually look really And then to make it actually look really nice, I just need to throw on an nice, I just need to throw on an nice, I just need to throw on an emission color. Crank it up a bit. And emission color. Crank it up a bit. And emission color. Crank it up a bit. And then uh let's go and and filmic. Oh, a then uh let's go and and filmic. Oh, a then uh let's go and and filmic. Oh, a few other things. few other things. few other things. Uh Uh Uh I got it confirmed what I think was a I got it confirmed what I think was a I got it confirmed what I think was a community developer that the video community developer that the video community developer that the video sequence editor is currently only CPU sequence editor is currently only CPU sequence editor is currently only CPU for for for uh the modifiers. So, the compositor uh the modifiers. So, the compositor uh the modifiers. So, the compositor modifiers, but they're looking into modifiers, but they're looking into modifiers, but they're looking into getting it to work with the GPU. Uh, not getting it to work with the GPU. Uh, not getting it to work with the GPU. Uh, not for 5.0, but in the future, which is for 5.0, but in the future, which is for 5.0, but in the future, which is cool to hear. It being cached helps cool to hear. It being cached helps cool to hear. It being cached helps quite a bit. So, quite a bit. So, quite a bit. So, let's do that. Go back to geo nodes. Go let's do that. Go back to geo nodes. Go let's do that. Go back to geo nodes. Go and get it to be all white. Oh, yeah. and get it to be all white. Oh, yeah. and get it to be all white. Oh, yeah. Turn down the saturation norm. It is normalized already, right? norm. It is normalized already, right? norm. It is normalized already, right? Something doesn't seem right. Something doesn't seem right. Something doesn't seem right. It's too saturated. Shouldn't be that It's too saturated. Shouldn't be that It's too saturated. Shouldn't be that saturated though. I guess there's always saturated though. I guess there's always saturated though. I guess there's always AGX, which is so desaturated. But actually, I which is so desaturated. But actually, I which is so desaturated. But actually, I could go and pull could go and pull could go and pull my my my aces thing, but that goes and messes aces thing, but that goes and messes aces thing, but that goes and messes with the bloom quite a bit. with the bloom quite a bit. with the bloom quite a bit. We could just do the bloom before We could just do the bloom before We could just do the bloom before That could work quite well. Yeah. Let's That could work quite well. Yeah. Let's That could work quite well. Yeah. Let's go over to standard and I'm going to go over to standard and I'm going to go over to standard and I'm going to pull my ASUS color transform node group pull my ASUS color transform node group pull my ASUS color transform node group uh file append. Let me try to ah yes uh file append. Let me try to ah yes uh file append. Let me try to ah yes it's right here. Uh node tree it's right here. Uh node tree it's right here. Uh node tree as cinematic. Yes. Let's go back to the as cinematic. Yes. Let's go back to the as cinematic. Yes. Let's go back to the compositor. compositor. compositor. So uh TM is cinematic. Let's apply that So uh TM is cinematic. Let's apply that So uh TM is cinematic. Let's apply that beforehand. Go into the geo node tab. beforehand. Go into the geo node tab. beforehand. Go into the geo node tab. Take a look at it. We should see the bloom is not working as I intended. the bloom is not working as I intended. the bloom is not working as I intended. So, if I do this in post, So, if I do this in post, So, if I do this in post, [Music] [Music] [Music] we'll see. Oh, wait. No, that that's we'll see. Oh, wait. No, that that's we'll see. Oh, wait. No, that that's what I was supposed to do. Accidentally what I was supposed to do. Accidentally what I was supposed to do. Accidentally put beforehand. put beforehand. put beforehand. Uh, let's go back to comp. Take that Uh, let's go back to comp. Take that Uh, let's go back to comp. Take that out. Right. Because the color transform out. Right. Because the color transform out. Right. Because the color transform always has to be does has to be done always has to be does has to be done always has to be does has to be done before the bloom, I think. before the bloom, I think. before the bloom, I think. Although, wait, why does it work? Although, wait, why does it work? Although, wait, why does it work? Oh, no. Wait, that makes sense. Yeah, Oh, no. Wait, that makes sense. Yeah, Oh, no. Wait, that makes sense. Yeah, bloom happens before the color bloom happens before the color bloom happens before the color transforms. I had that wrong before. transforms. I had that wrong before. transforms. I had that wrong before. Makes a lot of sense. Makes a lot of sense. Makes a lot of sense. Here, I could just do some really funky Here, I could just do some really funky Here, I could just do some really funky stuff. Although let's go back to the geo node editor and let's go back to the geo node editor and let's go back to the geo node editor and is this actually affecting nope that is is this actually affecting nope that is is this actually affecting nope that is affecting that. So if I were to scale affecting that. So if I were to scale affecting that. So if I were to scale the velocity offset by negative one the velocity offset by negative one the velocity offset by negative one [Music] [Music] [Music] actually no actually no actually no we need to we need to we need to wait I need to wait how do I do this again I I need to wait how do I do this again I I need to wait how do I do this again I need to set the velocity and then apply need to set the velocity and then apply need to set the velocity and then apply the velocity afterwards. So in this case the velocity afterwards. So in this case the velocity afterwards. So in this case it would be more like this. it would be more like this. it would be more like this. So So So oh my brain is really really straining oh my brain is really really straining oh my brain is really really straining right now. right now. right now. We don't need to do field to grid. I We don't need to do field to grid. I We don't need to do field to grid. I don't think what we need to do is don't think what we need to do is don't think what we need to do is get the named grid my brain. Oh I can get the named grid my brain. Oh I can get the named grid my brain. Oh I can feel the gears in my brain just feel the gears in my brain just feel the gears in my brain just completely halting at the thought of completely halting at the thought of completely halting at the thought of this. do that this. do that this. do that and then we get this and then we get this and then we get this and completely break everything. and completely break everything. and completely break everything. We take that out. We take that out. We We take that out. We take that out. We We take that out. We take that out. We get the position. We plug that into get the position. We plug that into get the position. We plug that into there. And then we plug you hopefully there. And then we plug you hopefully there. And then we plug you hopefully into here and it doesn't break into here and it doesn't break into here and it doesn't break everything even though it does. everything even though it does. everything even though it does. What's going on, buddy? But it expects a field or a singular But it expects a field or a singular But it expects a field or a singular value. value. value. I know it shouldn't because I've done I know it shouldn't because I've done I know it shouldn't because I've done this before. this before. this before. The position. Um. Um. Um. Yeah. No, but it's a sample. Wait. Yeah. No, but it's a sample. Wait. Yeah. No, but it's a sample. Wait. Oh, Oh, Oh, that just not needed. I I think I I think I royally royally I I think I I think I royally royally I I think I I think I royally royally screwed up. screwed up. screwed up. Set that to be zero. Mhm. Yep. Nope. Just disappears. Mhm. Yep. Nope. Just disappears. Mhm. Yep. Nope. Just disappears. Completely expected. Completely expected. Completely expected. Yep. Yep. Yep. I don't know what I expected, but that I don't know what I expected, but that I don't know what I expected, but that was one of them. was one of them. was one of them. H H H Mhm. Yep. Seems good. Seems good to me. Mhm. Yep. Seems good. Seems good to me. Mhm. Yep. Seems good. Seems good to me. A field or a singular value. But wait, A field or a singular value. But wait, A field or a singular value. But wait, what did I screw? Wait, let's check the what did I screw? Wait, let's check the what did I screw? Wait, let's check the reference. reference. reference. We have that D and that's fine, but it's We have that D and that's fine, but it's We have that D and that's fine, but it's not referencing a grid, which may be the not referencing a grid, which may be the not referencing a grid, which may be the key. key. key. [Music] [Music] [Music] So, [Music] I need to use like a grid to field. I need to use like a grid to field. I need to use like a grid to field. Let's delete you so that it doesn't Let's delete you so that it doesn't Let's delete you so that it doesn't confuse me anymore. This is complicated confuse me anymore. This is complicated confuse me anymore. This is complicated stuff. So wait, we have the grid and then we So wait, we have the grid and then we So wait, we have the grid and then we have grid feeding into that which we have grid feeding into that which we have grid feeding into that which we actually wait actually wait actually wait [Music] [Music] [Music] that doesn't want to connect to there. that doesn't want to connect to there. that doesn't want to connect to there. But did I screw up? But did I screw up? But did I screw up? It's not like that. then everything's It's not like that. then everything's It's not like that. then everything's fine fine fine because it's a field. But a grid is a because it's a field. But a grid is a because it's a field. But a grid is a singular value. So I would have to oh singular value. So I would have to oh singular value. So I would have to oh right I would need to sample the grid right I would need to sample the grid right I would need to sample the grid and have the position which I assume that's have the position which I assume that's have the position which I assume that's the default but anyway and most likely the default but anyway and most likely the default but anyway and most likely this conversion layer is not needed this conversion layer is not needed this conversion layer is not needed but but but eh eh eh and that's not moving at all and that's not moving at all and that's not moving at all but it's acting as if it is fracturing but it's acting as if it is fracturing but it's acting as if it is fracturing it into a tiny little a ton of tiny it into a tiny little a ton of tiny it into a tiny little a ton of tiny little chunks. So, we get it, So, we get it, So, we get it, we sample it, and then we put it back. we sample it, and then we put it back. we sample it, and then we put it back. So, yes, this conversion layer is most So, yes, this conversion layer is most So, yes, this conversion layer is most likely not needed at all, but it's the likely not needed at all, but it's the likely not needed at all, but it's the only way I know it. And that And that And that the noise scale is zero but it's giving the noise scale is zero but it's giving the noise scale is zero but it's giving a noise pattern which means that a noise pattern which means that a noise pattern which means that ah that explains a lot. ah that explains a lot. ah that explains a lot. So we need to keep this low very low. Ah So we need to keep this low very low. Ah So we need to keep this low very low. Ah there we go. there we go. there we go. [Music] Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. Almost uh Conway's game of lifeish. [Music] Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Most interesting. I don't know what it is, but hey, if it I don't know what it is, but hey, if it I don't know what it is, but hey, if it looks cool, I'll take it. So, we can looks cool, I'll take it. So, we can looks cool, I'll take it. So, we can have some initial velocity right here have some initial velocity right here have some initial velocity right here and then make it move. and then make it move. and then make it move. I think just for making my brain a I think just for making my brain a I think just for making my brain a little bit better, I'm going to little bit better, I'm going to little bit better, I'm going to not. But we do need to voxilize the grid not. But we do need to voxilize the grid not. But we do need to voxilize the grid beforehand. beforehand. beforehand. So yeah, I created acid. I created acid. I created acid. Oh, that acid. Oh, that acid. Oh, that acid. Yeah, I guess so. Remember kids, don't do drugs. Remember kids, don't do drugs. Remember kids, don't do drugs. Uh, we could have that, which is Uh, we could have that, which is Uh, we could have that, which is interesting, interesting, interesting, though. No, I think normalized looks a though. No, I think normalized looks a though. No, I think normalized looks a bit better. bit better. bit better. Bit of glow. Bit of glow. Bit of glow. And who knows, we could uh throw in some And who knows, we could uh throw in some And who knows, we could uh throw in some weird compositing stuff just to make it weird compositing stuff just to make it weird compositing stuff just to make it look all nice and fancy glare. Let's use look all nice and fancy glare. Let's use look all nice and fancy glare. Let's use the new um sunbeams. the new um sunbeams. the new um sunbeams. Ah, yes. Ah, yes. Ah, yes. Yep. You love to see it. Maybe a bit more. Maybe a bit more. Maybe a bit more. I know that's too strong. And then what about a lens dis? Yeah, And then what about a lens dis? Yeah, And then what about a lens dis? Yeah, let's just really cook this big time. let's just really cook this big time. let's just really cook this big time. Lens dispersion. Ah. Oh, Ah. Oh, Ah. Oh, you love to see it. Ah. Yes. [Music] [Music] [Music] H. H. H. [Music] [Music] [Music] Everyone loves chromatic aberration. Hear people love it when you put it in Hear people love it when you put it in Hear people love it when you put it in games.

This loses volume because of All right. This loses volume because of All right. This loses volume because of the um the the thingy. Uh what was I talking about? Uh what was I talking about? Uh what was I talking about? Uh let's also Yeah, let's have this be Uh let's also Yeah, let's have this be Uh let's also Yeah, let's have this be ghosts instead. Strength. modulation. Oh, yeah. No, that that modulation. Oh, yeah. No, that that modulation. Oh, yeah. No, that that works quite well. works quite well. works quite well. Uh, and if we turn the strength up, it's Uh, and if we turn the strength up, it's Uh, and if we turn the strength up, it's just like, oh yeah, really just make just like, oh yeah, really just make just like, oh yeah, really just make them trip. Yeah. Now that that's the good stuff Yeah. Now that that's the good stuff Yeah. Now that that's the good stuff right there. I just got a warning. Heads up. We I just got a warning. Heads up.

Yes, but it you subdivide the grid more. Yes, but it you subdivide the grid more. Yes, but it will start to slow down. will start to slow down. will start to slow down. Let's set this to be 150. This will not Let's set this to be 150. This will not Let's set this to be 150. This will not be fun. Again, we're doing stuff that people Again, we're doing stuff that people Again, we're doing stuff that people usually usually usually like to do on the GPU just because like to do on the GPU just because like to do on the GPU just because again, this is probably millions of again, this is probably millions of again, this is probably millions of well, maybe a million actually. Wait, we well, maybe a million actually. Wait, we well, maybe a million actually. Wait, we have 150 cube. Uh, let me get my have 150 cube. Uh, let me get my have 150 cube.

Okay. 150 to the power of calculators. Okay. 150 to the power of calculators. Okay. 150 to the power of three. That is 3,375,000 three. That is 3,375,000 three. That is 3,375,000 voxels. voxels. voxels. Yeah, that that's that makes sense. Yeah, that that's that makes sense. Yeah, that that's that makes sense. Makes sense. [Music] [Music] [Music] In case you ever want to save a stream In case you ever want to save a stream In case you ever want to save a stream with copyright music, you can isolate with copyright music, you can isolate with copyright music, you can isolate your voice in Dinci Resolve your voice in Dinci Resolve your voice in Dinci Resolve automatically. Don't know if it's studio automatically. Don't know if it's studio automatically. Don't know if it's studio only version though. Uh yeah, I I don't only version though. Uh yeah, I I don't only version though. Uh yeah, I I don't really care too much about really care too much about really care too much about if the stream gets like I if the stream gets like I if the stream gets like I I had a feeling that this song has I had a feeling that this song has I had a feeling that this song has gotten copy copyright claims before, but gotten copy copyright claims before, but gotten copy copyright claims before, but I assumed it was one of those like fake I assumed it was one of those like fake I assumed it was one of those like fake copyright bots, but apparently maybe I copyright bots, but apparently maybe I copyright bots, but apparently maybe I was wrong. was wrong. was wrong. Um, but yeah, I I knew that going in. I Um, but yeah, I I knew that going in. I Um, but yeah, I I knew that going in. I just wanted different music from the just wanted different music from the just wanted different music from the Zelda one that I've been using for the Zelda one that I've been using for the Zelda one that I've been using for the past 15 million years. past 15 million years. past 15 million years. Yeah, that's what uh this looks like Yeah, that's what uh this looks like Yeah, that's what uh this looks like with more voxels. with more voxels. with more voxels. And it's only a resolution of 150x 150x And it's only a resolution of 150x 150x And it's only a resolution of 150x 150x 150, which I guess is a testament to 150, which I guess is a testament to 150, which I guess is a testament to just uh how expensive voxels are just just uh how expensive voxels are just just uh how expensive voxels are just because of it being cubed. All right. Uh, so yeah, we still got All right. Uh, so yeah, we still got All right. Uh, so yeah, we still got that. That's still going. I think that that. That's still going. I think that that. That's still going. I think that is a good place to is a good place to is a good place to end the stream cuz I've been delaying. end the stream cuz I've been delaying. end the stream cuz I've been delaying. We're almost at an hour and 20 minutes. We're almost at an hour and 20 minutes. We're almost at an hour and 20 minutes. That is uh a bit too long. I got stuff That is uh a bit too long. I got stuff That is uh a bit too long. I got stuff to do. Yeah. And also I can h can I do? Yeah, I can actually. I can h can I do? Yeah, I can actually. I can h can I do? Yeah, I can actually. If I store this as a velocity value uh on here and export this as an olympic uh on here and export this as an olympic uh on here and export this as an olympic and then bring it back in. Actually, and then bring it back in. Actually, and then bring it back in. Actually, will cycles read this as let me save will cycles read this as let me save will cycles read this as let me save this beforehand. this beforehand. this beforehand. Edit preferences add-ons. Cycles you in Edit preferences add-ons. Cycles you in Edit preferences add-ons. Cycles you in here? Ah, yes. It's a full build, so here? Ah, yes. It's a full build, so here? Ah, yes. It's a full build, so cycles is around. cycles is around. cycles is around. [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh no. If Yeah. No, I'm not going to do Oh no. If Yeah. No, I'm not going to do Oh no. If Yeah. No, I'm not going to do the colonels now. That'll take too long. the colonels now. That'll take too long. the colonels now. That'll take too long. In theory, if I run then [Music] ah that's why ah that's why ah that's why uh I think scale or divide this by 24. uh I think scale or divide this by 24. uh I think scale or divide this by 24. But no, there's no motion blur at the But no, there's no motion blur at the But no, there's no motion blur at the moment. It's not even enabled. Is it moment. It's not even enabled. Is it moment. It's not even enabled. Is it just not working? Where motion blur? Come on, working? Where motion blur? Come on, working? Where motion blur? Come on, buddy. Um, you can store the velocity buddy. Um, you can store the velocity buddy. Um, you can store the velocity and then the motion blur would work, and then the motion blur would work, and then the motion blur would work, but but but right now I can't even see the thing right now I can't even see the thing right now I can't even see the thing here. here. here. GPU is not available. Okay. GPU is not available. Okay. GPU is not available. Okay.

Well, that's the end of the Oh my god. Well, that's the end of the stream, everyone. I hope you all stream, everyone. I hope you all stream, everyone. I hope you all enjoyed. Blender just straight up enjoyed. Blender just straight up enjoyed. Blender just straight up crashed. crashed. crashed. Um, yeah, I'm assuming that's just Um, yeah, I'm assuming that's just Um, yeah, I'm assuming that's just because of a build. But thank you all because of a build. But thank you all because of a build. But thank you all for watching. I hope you all enjoyed a for watching. I hope you all enjoyed a for watching. I hope you all enjoyed a little look into this. Again, the little look into this. Again, the little look into this. Again, the adction node is probably on the way and adction node is probably on the way and adction node is probably on the way and that would make uh simulations a lot lot that would make uh simulations a lot lot that would make uh simulations a lot lot faster. faster. faster. So, like it would make volume So, like it would make volume So, like it would make volume simulations a lot easier to do. I think simulations a lot easier to do. I think simulations a lot easier to do. I think right now they are possible, but I'm right now they are possible, but I'm right now they are possible, but I'm just I don't know. I forgot how to do just I don't know. I forgot how to do just I don't know. I forgot how to do them. So, thank you all for watching and them. So, thank you all for watching and them. So, thank you all for watching and I'll see you all next time. Have a good I'll see you all next time. Have a good I'll see you all next time. Have a good one.
