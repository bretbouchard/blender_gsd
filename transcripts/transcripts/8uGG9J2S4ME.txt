Hi, today we will make this effect. The Hi, today we will make this effect. The Hi, today we will make this effect. The inspiration comes from uh the movie inspiration comes from uh the movie inspiration comes from uh the movie Doctor Strange. I think it's from the Doctor Strange. I think it's from the Doctor Strange. I think it's from the 2016 Doctor Strange. Before we begin our 2016 Doctor Strange. Before we begin our 2016 Doctor Strange. Before we begin our tutorial, I will explain the principle tutorial, I will explain the principle tutorial, I will explain the principle generally. We can see the house. this generally. We can see the house. this generally. We can see the house. this line, this line, this line. They clipped line, this line, this line. They clipped line, this line, this line. They clipped the geometry with just a normal method. the geometry with just a normal method. the geometry with just a normal method. You can't make this. I made this by the You can't make this. I made this by the You can't make this. I made this by the shade mode. shade mode. shade mode. Uh in shading there there is like which Uh in shading there there is like which Uh in shading there there is like which one? The first one. Yeah, I use RFA. RFA one? The first one. Yeah, I use RFA. RFA one? The first one. Yeah, I use RFA. RFA is the most important one in this is the most important one in this is the most important one in this effect. The first step of this effect is effect. The first step of this effect is effect. The first step of this effect is the geometry node. And uh just a little the geometry node. And uh just a little the geometry node. And uh just a little bit of geometry node I will show you. bit of geometry node I will show you. bit of geometry node I will show you. It's very simple. First we need a mesh It's very simple. First we need a mesh It's very simple. First we need a mesh circle circle circle and the instance on and the instance on and the instance on on it. And here I will I will just use a on it. And here I will I will just use a on it. And here I will I will just use a cube for demonstration. Just click it cube for demonstration. Just click it cube for demonstration. Just click it just link it to instance and uh link it just link it to instance and uh link it just link it to instance and uh link it here. Okay. Okay. Okay. And use a transform geometry node here. And use a transform geometry node here. And use a transform geometry node here. Yeah. To make it a 90° because because I Yeah. To make it a 90° because because I Yeah. To make it a 90° because because I prefer this way prefer this way prefer this way and I think there are too much too too many I think there are too much too too many I think there are too much too too many cubes. I need a less. So we need to cubes. I need a less. So we need to cubes. I need a less. So we need to decrease the vertices. decrease the vertices. decrease the vertices. So four. Yeah, four is okay. And next we So four. Yeah, four is okay. And next we So four. Yeah, four is okay. And next we make the animation. make the animation. make the animation. We also use transform geometry and uh we We also use transform geometry and uh we We also use transform geometry and uh we took the rotation like this. So took the rotation like this. So took the rotation like this. So we use a combine XYZ click to rotation we use a combine XYZ click to rotation we use a combine XYZ click to rotation and and and with with with with time here put the time here seconds with time here put the time here seconds with time here put the time here seconds connected to X and you will have this connected to X and you will have this connected to X and you will have this effect. effect. effect. So this is the basic effect. So this is the basic effect. So this is the basic effect. And here another one we need to put the And here another one we need to put the And here another one we need to put the integers here. Put the vertices here. integers here. Put the vertices here. integers here. Put the vertices here. And then And then And then we store we need to store the integer we store we need to store the integer we store we need to store the integer store the integer here. and we call it uh and we call it uh and we call it uh number. number. number. So, so I I think that's all we need. So, so I I think that's all we need. So, so I I think that's all we need. And uh before we start the shading, we And uh before we start the shading, we And uh before we start the shading, we need to increase this because I want it need to increase this because I want it need to increase this because I want it obvious, very obvious for you to see obvious, very obvious for you to see obvious, very obvious for you to see that. that. that. So then we need to save it. So then we need to save it. So then we need to save it. Okay, this is the first part and next Okay, this is the first part and next Okay, this is the first part and next let's go to the CD mode here. let's go to the CD mode here. let's go to the CD mode here. So So So I will make a bigger cube here. So just I will make a bigger cube here. So just I will make a bigger cube here. So just uh uh uh just for like for easier explanation. just for like for easier explanation. just for like for easier explanation. So first I will show you the basic So first I will show you the basic So first I will show you the basic principle I make this. So we control T. principle I make this. So we control T. principle I make this. So we control T. We have this basic node assist and We have this basic node assist and We have this basic node assist and delete the image delete the image delete the image and use separate XYZ and use separate XYZ and use separate XYZ and remember to link the object to and remember to link the object to and remember to link the object to vector and then control shift and left vector and then control shift and left vector and then control shift and left click of mouse. So you will have this. click of mouse. So you will have this. click of mouse. So you will have this. So here I use Z. So here I use Z. So here I use Z. So this uh and uh you can see So this uh and uh you can see So this uh and uh you can see that uh it's blurry in the middle. So I that uh it's blurry in the middle. So I that uh it's blurry in the middle. So I don't want that. So I use mass don't want that. So I use mass don't want that. So I use mass here here here greater than if it's greater than zero greater than if it's greater than zero greater than if it's greater than zero we want it to be we want it to be we want it to be uh one. The white the value of white is uh one. The white the value of white is uh one. The white the value of white is one. So that's what we need. And after one. So that's what we need. And after one. So that's what we need. And after we make this basic structure and you we make this basic structure and you we make this basic structure and you rotate you rotate this X Y Z UI find Y rotate you rotate this X Y Z UI find Y rotate you rotate this X Y Z UI find Y direction you can make it move. direction you can make it move. direction you can make it move. The principle of this effect is that The principle of this effect is that The principle of this effect is that clip the geometry like this here is clip the geometry like this here is clip the geometry like this here is alpha. The angle is alpha. alpha. The angle is alpha. alpha. The angle is alpha. So this alpha comes from like So this alpha comes from like So this alpha comes from like 2 pi divided the number. 2 pi divided the number. 2 pi divided the number. So we will get uh an angle 2 pi is 360° and the number is what we stored in our and the number is what we stored in our and the number is what we stored in our last step. It's a number of the last step. It's a number of the last step. It's a number of the instance. instance. instance. So here if if the number like um So here if if the number like um So here if if the number like um increased this alpha decrease. increased this alpha decrease. increased this alpha decrease. So here So here So here like here is the original line. like here is the original line. like here is the original line. If we make it zero here is original line If we make it zero here is original line If we make it zero here is original line and uh this is alpha we need the first and uh this is alpha we need the first and uh this is alpha we need the first first we need to like divide it by two. first we need to like divide it by two. first we need to like divide it by two. we divide then this alpha into we divide then this alpha into we divide then this alpha into two half alpha. So what we need to do is two half alpha. So what we need to do is two half alpha. So what we need to do is to make this alpha here. So my method is to make this alpha here. So my method is to make this alpha here. So my method is to to to like first make the first uh half alpha like first make the first uh half alpha like first make the first uh half alpha here and then stretch this line here. uh here and then stretch this line here. uh here and then stretch this line here. uh you will f you will find this one is you will f you will find this one is you will f you will find this one is vertical vertical vertical and uh this half alpha half alpha and and uh this half alpha half alpha and and uh this half alpha half alpha and this angle is beta alpha and beta uh this angle is beta alpha and beta uh this angle is beta alpha and beta uh equals 90° equals 90° equals 90° so you will find also here half alpha so you will find also here half alpha so you will find also here half alpha half alpha and beta it's also 90° so half alpha and beta it's also 90° so half alpha and beta it's also 90° so it's 90° here it's 90° here it's 90° here so we want the white space to so we want the white space to so we want the white space to be Here be Here be Here first we need to make this half alpha first we need to make this half alpha first we need to make this half alpha here. So here. So here. So we need to make uh this angle. we need to make uh this angle. we need to make uh this angle. So here uh I I think it's uh the angle So here uh I I think it's uh the angle So here uh I I think it's uh the angle here is here is here is 90°. So 90 degree is a 90°. So 90 degree is a 90°. So 90 degree is a uh half pi divide uh half pi divide uh half pi divide half r. So this is this angle. Uh but half r. So this is this angle. Uh but half r. So this is this angle. Uh but actually like if you rotate it in this actually like if you rotate it in this actually like if you rotate it in this direction there will be minus here. So direction there will be minus here. So direction there will be minus here. So minus this you will get this angle. So minus this you will get this angle. So minus this you will get this angle. So this is the principle this is the principle this is the principle and let's make it by this principle. So I will So I will So I will just a random value if if if the just a random value if if if the just a random value if if if the I divide two. Yes. Yes. If it's a four I divide two. Yes. Yes. If it's a four I divide two. Yes. Yes. If it's a four instance. So the angle we get is this instance. So the angle we get is this instance. So the angle we get is this value. And the first step we uh divide divide two. uh divide divide two. uh divide divide two. Yeah, you can see. Yeah, you can see. Yeah, you can see. And this this equals And this this equals And this this equals half r uh half r uh half r uh subtract half pi. So first divide and f subtract half pi. So first divide and f subtract half pi. So first divide and f next subtract subtract half pi. pi half pi here and subtract half pi. pi half pi here and subtract half pi. pi half pi here and then connect it to y. So we have this then connect it to y. So we have this then connect it to y. So we have this angle angle angle because it's 90° so it's like this. So because it's 90° so it's like this. So because it's 90° so it's like this. So this is the first part this is the first part this is the first part and uh we need to make another part is and uh we need to make another part is and uh we need to make another part is here here here here with uh com first this part another here with uh com first this part another here with uh com first this part another this part and then combine them this part and then combine them this part and then combine them together. together. together. So by making this is uh this much much So by making this is uh this much much So by making this is uh this much much more simple. more simple. more simple. So we just need to So we just need to So we just need to multiply multiply multiply -1 -1 -1 and copy all of them here and copy all of them here and copy all of them here connected to y connected to y connected to y and uh then you preview it. It's uh and uh then you preview it. It's uh and uh then you preview it. It's uh reversed. It's reversed. Yeah. So just reversed. It's reversed. Yeah. So just reversed. It's reversed. Yeah. So just by multiply negative one. And the next step we need to combine And the next step we need to combine And the next step we need to combine them together. So here I just use them together. So here I just use them together. So here I just use multiply multiply multiply because the white part is one, black because the white part is one, black because the white part is one, black part is zero. Uh 0 multiply one is zero. part is zero. Uh 0 multiply one is zero. part is zero. Uh 0 multiply one is zero. So white part uh by using multiply we So white part uh by using multiply we So white part uh by using multiply we get only the white part. get only the white part. get only the white part. So yeah that's what we have. So yeah that's what we have. So yeah that's what we have. And uh next we link the shed here we And uh next we link the shed here we And uh next we link the shed here we connect to RFI. So we have this. connect to RFI. So we have this. connect to RFI. So we have this. So you can see So you can see So you can see it already have effect on the geometry it already have effect on the geometry it already have effect on the geometry inside. So we hide this value and go to inside. So we hide this value and go to inside. So we hide this value and go to the original geometry nodes the original geometry nodes the original geometry nodes and uh we need to reply uh replace this and uh we need to reply uh replace this and uh we need to reply uh replace this value. value. value. here I use here I use here I use no attribute and uh what we stored I think it's and uh what we stored I think it's and uh what we stored I think it's called a number the number of the called a number the number of the called a number the number of the geometry so to get the ar we need a math geometry so to get the ar we need a math geometry so to get the ar we need a math node node node as what I said 2 pi divide number as what I said 2 pi divide number as what I said 2 pi divide number two pi divide number here two pi divide number here two pi divide number here and and and connect it to here. connect it to here. connect it to here. So I think that's that's what I what So I think that's that's what I what So I think that's that's what I what what I need. So let's go to geometry what I need. So let's go to geometry what I need. So let's go to geometry nodes here. nodes here. nodes here. Let's try if if it worked. Let's try if if it worked. Let's try if if it worked. So here So here So here and uh yeah the integer is here. That's and uh yeah the integer is here. That's and uh yeah the integer is here. That's the number of the instance. If we the number of the instance. If we the number of the instance. If we increase the number you can see the increase the number you can see the increase the number you can see the clipping. I think it's right. Yeah. And clipping. I think it's right. Yeah. And clipping. I think it's right. Yeah. And I think we're almost there. Just uh I think we're almost there. Just uh I think we're almost there. Just uh remember to reduce remember to reduce remember to reduce this value to very small value. So you this value to very small value. So you this value to very small value. So you will have this. And let's play the will have this. And let's play the will have this. And let's play the animation. Okay. Uh let's clean all all this. Let's Okay. Uh let's clean all all this. Let's Okay. Uh let's clean all all this. Let's clean all this. clean all this. clean all this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And I think we get what we want. Okay. And I think we get what we want. Okay. And I think we get what we want. So next we need to find a geometry to So next we need to find a geometry to So next we need to find a geometry to replace this cube. So if you replace this cube. So if you replace this cube. So if you find a house in find a house in find a house in I think it's called blank kit I think it's called blank kit I think it's called blank kit and uh if you have like this house here and uh if you have like this house here and uh if you have like this house here if you want to make this animation by if you want to make this animation by if you want to make this animation by this house this house this house uh it's here. So first step you need to uh it's here. So first step you need to uh it's here. So first step you need to you must do ltp clear parent. If we you must do ltp clear parent. If we you must do ltp clear parent. If we don't do this, you can't make the don't do this, you can't make the don't do this, you can't make the animation. animation. animation. Yeah. So, delete this uh empty So, delete this uh empty So, delete this uh empty and uh then let's go to shading. and uh then let's go to shading. and uh then let's go to shading. Go to material. Go to material. Go to material. So, we will copy all of the ARA part. What happened? Okay. There there is something wrong Okay. There there is something wrong Okay. There there is something wrong with the with the shading. Yeah, that is with the with the shading. Yeah, that is with the with the shading. Yeah, that is right. So first, so first we go to cube uh copy the ara so first we go to cube uh copy the ara so first we go to cube uh copy the ara part and then go to the geometry here. part and then go to the geometry here. part and then go to the geometry here. Go to the building here. Paste them here Go to the building here. Paste them here Go to the building here. Paste them here and uh connect it to ARA and uh connect it to ARA and uh connect it to ARA and go to another uh this is the roof and go to another uh this is the roof and go to another uh this is the roof and uh paste it here. connect to alpha and uh paste it here. connect to alpha and uh paste it here. connect to alpha and then you see everything disappeared. and then you see everything disappeared. and then you see everything disappeared. Uh don't worry we will fix it later. So Uh don't worry we will fix it later. So Uh don't worry we will fix it later. So we go to geometry node and uh we drag we go to geometry node and uh we drag we go to geometry node and uh we drag the I yeah the I yeah the I yeah drag the horse here drag the horse here drag the horse here and uh and uh and uh connect replace it with the cube here. connect replace it with the cube here. connect replace it with the cube here. hide the original host hide the original host hide the original host and let's see if it worked. Yeah, it and let's see if it worked. Yeah, it and let's see if it worked. Yeah, it worked. You can see the empty part. It worked. So, let's increase the numbers. You can So, let's increase the numbers. You can So, let's increase the numbers. You can see it's perfect. Okay, that's a whole see it's perfect. Okay, that's a whole see it's perfect. Okay, that's a whole tutorial. Hope you like it. Thank you tutorial. Hope you like it. Thank you tutorial. Hope you like it. Thank you for watching. Bye-bye.
