How cool would it be to get a text file How cool would it be to get a text file How cool would it be to get a text file and then run some kind of processing and then run some kind of processing and then run some kind of processing that outputs your handwriting? And I that outputs your handwriting? And I that outputs your handwriting? And I know what you're thinking. CG Matter, know what you're thinking. CG Matter, know what you're thinking. CG Matter, did you just describe a handwriting did you just describe a handwriting did you just describe a handwriting font? Listen, I know these exist, but font? Listen, I know these exist, but font? Listen, I know these exist, but this is different because not only is it this is different because not only is it this is different because not only is it your own handwriting, but it's going to your own handwriting, but it's going to your own handwriting, but it's going to randomize each letter. So, not every randomize each letter. So, not every randomize each letter. So, not every letter A is going to be the same as the letter A is going to be the same as the letter A is going to be the same as the next. Every letter K or whatever is next. Every letter K or whatever is next. Every letter K or whatever is going to be varied. This video is going to be varied. This video is going to be varied. This video is sponsored by Squarespace, and we're sponsored by Squarespace, and we're sponsored by Squarespace, and we're going to talk about that later. So, the going to talk about that later. So, the going to talk about that later. So, the first thing we need is we need to write first thing we need is we need to write first thing we need is we need to write some stuff. I have my paper. I I should some stuff. I have my paper. I I should some stuff. I have my paper. I I should have a pen. That's a pretty critical have a pen. That's a pretty critical have a pen. That's a pretty critical part of this when you say for each part of this when you say for each part of this when you say for each letter I'm going to write let's say letter I'm going to write let's say letter I'm going to write let's say three variants to start. So I'm going to three variants to start. So I'm going to three variants to start. So I'm going to have the letter A and then I'm going to have the letter A and then I'm going to have the letter A and then I'm going to write it again and then again. Now these write it again and then again. Now these write it again and then again. Now these are all going to be slightly different are all going to be slightly different are all going to be slightly different from each other. Not majorly but enough from each other. Not majorly but enough from each other. Not majorly but enough that it's not registering. Wow, this is that it's not registering. Wow, this is that it's not registering. Wow, this is the same one each time. And I could even the same one each time. And I could even the same one each time. And I could even deliberately kind of mess up one of deliberately kind of mess up one of deliberately kind of mess up one of these letters so that they don't look these letters so that they don't look these letters so that they don't look perfect. And I'm just going to go down perfect. And I'm just going to go down perfect. And I'm just going to go down the list here. If you want capitals, you the list here. If you want capitals, you the list here. If you want capitals, you also have to make a capital letter set. also have to make a capital letter set. also have to make a capital letter set. [music] And same with numbers, etc. [music] And same with numbers, etc. [music] And same with numbers, etc. Jeez, that was painful. I'm only going Jeez, that was painful. I'm only going Jeez, that was painful. I'm only going for lowercase. Our next step, of course, for lowercase. Our next step, of course, for lowercase. Our next step, of course, is going to be scanning this in. Drop is going to be scanning this in. Drop is going to be scanning this in. Drop that bad boy in here. This isn't a that bad boy in here. This isn't a that bad boy in here. This isn't a printer tutorial because I I don't even printer tutorial because I I don't even printer tutorial because I I don't even know how to use my own. Well, it's doing know how to use my own. Well, it's doing know how to use my own. Well, it's doing something. Okay, let's see what we got something. Okay, let's see what we got something. Okay, let's see what we got on the old computer. So, PNG. Too many on the old computer. So, PNG. Too many on the old computer. So, PNG. Too many settings. Don't care. Okay, so here we settings. Don't care. Okay, so here we settings. Don't care. Okay, so here we have our image. It's fairly high have our image. It's fairly high have our image. It's fairly high resolution, which is good. I wanted to resolution, which is good. I wanted to resolution, which is good. I wanted to have that texture. One of the big have that texture. One of the big have that texture. One of the big problems here is some letters are like problems here is some letters are like problems here is some letters are like wider than others. So, for example, you wider than others. So, for example, you wider than others. So, for example, you could say this a letter D quite skinny. could say this a letter D quite skinny. could say this a letter D quite skinny. Doesn't take a lot of horizontal space. Doesn't take a lot of horizontal space. Doesn't take a lot of horizontal space. whereas something like a I don't know whereas something like a I don't know whereas something like a I don't know it's like the worst offender and M is it's like the worst offender and M is it's like the worst offender and M is much wider. We somehow need to isolate much wider. We somehow need to isolate much wider. We somehow need to isolate the letters but beyond that have them be the letters but beyond that have them be the letters but beyond that have them be different widths. This is going to suck. different widths. This is going to suck. different widths. This is going to suck. Inside of I'm going to import in Inside of I'm going to import in Inside of I'm going to import in my image. And we're first going to do my image. And we're first going to do my image. And we're first going to do some processing to the image. And then some processing to the image. And then some processing to the image. And then we're going to isolate letter by letter. we're going to isolate letter by letter. we're going to isolate letter by letter. So for the overall processing, I don't So for the overall processing, I don't So for the overall processing, I don't need this to be transparent or anything. need this to be transparent or anything. need this to be transparent or anything. For all of these, let's first of all get For all of these, let's first of all get For all of these, let's first of all get rid of any unintentional color. So you rid of any unintentional color. So you rid of any unintentional color. So you can see here there's some like uh RGB can see here there's some like uh RGB can see here there's some like uh RGB noise. I'm going to get rid of that. And noise. I'm going to get rid of that. And noise. I'm going to get rid of that. And then the next thing is you could then the next thing is you could then the next thing is you could threshold it, but the thing about threshold it, but the thing about threshold it, but the thing about thresholding is you're going to kind of thresholding is you're going to kind of thresholding is you're going to kind of lose all of your detail, right? It's lose all of your detail, right? It's lose all of your detail, right? It's just a black or white mask, whereas just a black or white mask, whereas just a black or white mask, whereas there should be kind of those there should be kind of those there should be kind of those transparency values. So, I'm thinking transparency values. So, I'm thinking transparency values. So, I'm thinking let's run a levels on this where I could let's run a levels on this where I could let's run a levels on this where I could bring up the black. I guess I'm really bring up the black. I guess I'm really bring up the black. I guess I'm really just increasing the contrast, right? And just increasing the contrast, right? And just increasing the contrast, right? And if there are some kind of like pixels if there are some kind of like pixels if there are some kind of like pixels over here that survive for some reason, over here that survive for some reason, over here that survive for some reason, I'll just call that some graphite spill, I'll just call that some graphite spill, I'll just call that some graphite spill, right? That actually adds detail. And right? That actually adds detail. And right? That actually adds detail. And now the very painful process of letter now the very painful process of letter now the very painful process of letter by letter. This might be a good time to by letter. This might be a good time to by letter. This might be a good time to use like OCR detection. I'm going to use like OCR detection. I'm going to use like OCR detection. I'm going to make a selection. And the goal is to make a selection. And the goal is to make a selection. And the goal is to really get the bounds of the letter. really get the bounds of the letter. really get the bounds of the letter. Okay. I don't want to leave extra space Okay. I don't want to leave extra space Okay. I don't want to leave extra space where it isn't needed. So just kind of where it isn't needed. So just kind of where it isn't needed. So just kind of find the minimum or smallest bounding find the minimum or smallest bounding find the minimum or smallest bounding box. And then once you've isolated a box. And then once you've isolated a box. And then once you've isolated a letter, how do we kind of treat this? We letter, how do we kind of treat this? We letter, how do we kind of treat this? We go to image. We go to crop to selection. go to image. We go to crop to selection. go to image. We go to crop to selection. And now we have our letter file, export And now we have our letter file, export And now we have our letter file, export as inside of our letter folder. I'm as inside of our letter folder. I'm as inside of our letter folder. I'm going to call this A cuz it's the letter going to call this A cuz it's the letter going to call this A cuz it's the letter A_1 cuz it's the first instance. We're A_1 cuz it's the first instance. We're A_1 cuz it's the first instance. We're going to have 1 2 3 and JPEG's fine with going to have 1 2 3 and JPEG's fine with going to have 1 2 3 and JPEG's fine with me. This is like a trash. I don't know me. This is like a trash. I don't know me. This is like a trash. I don't know 50x 50 pixel image. Anyways, you go to 50x 50 pixel image. Anyways, you go to 50x 50 pixel image. Anyways, you go to the next one and you you put on a the next one and you you put on a the next one and you you put on a podcast. And just in case you're doing podcast. And just in case you're doing podcast. And just in case you're doing this along with me, let's pick a YouTube this along with me, let's pick a YouTube this along with me, let's pick a YouTube video together. The problem with the video together. The problem with the video together. The problem with the humanoid robot. Okay, this will do. See humanoid robot. Okay, this will do. See humanoid robot. Okay, this will do. See you in a minute. That took a you in a minute. That took a you in a minute. That took a legitimately aggravating amount of time legitimately aggravating amount of time legitimately aggravating amount of time and I just did the lowercase letters. and I just did the lowercase letters. and I just did the lowercase letters. This is the folder of everything I made. This is the folder of everything I made. This is the folder of everything I made. So, you can see a sub 1, a sub 2, a sub3 So, you can see a sub 1, a sub 2, a sub3 So, you can see a sub 1, a sub 2, a sub3 all the way to z sub 1, 2, and three. all the way to z sub 1, 2, and three. all the way to z sub 1, 2, and three. Also, you'll note that I made these Also, you'll note that I made these Also, you'll note that I made these three like blank ones, which I should three like blank ones, which I should three like blank ones, which I should probably rename. This represents space, probably rename. This represents space, probably rename. This represents space, as in there's a gap between letters. And as in there's a gap between letters. And as in there's a gap between letters. And you might think, why are there three of you might think, why are there three of you might think, why are there three of them? They're identical. It just makes them? They're identical. It just makes them? They're identical. It just makes the math easy since we want to randomize the math easy since we want to randomize the math easy since we want to randomize a choice between like three for each a choice between like three for each a choice between like three for each letter. So, I figured there can be three letter. So, I figured there can be three letter. So, I figured there can be three white spaces. Who cares? So, now our white spaces. Who cares? So, now our white spaces. Who cares? So, now our goal is basically to make a geometry goal is basically to make a geometry goal is basically to make a geometry node system that takes a piece of text node system that takes a piece of text node system that takes a piece of text and figures out not only which letters and figures out not only which letters and figures out not only which letters should be there, but it should randomize should be there, but it should randomize should be there, but it should randomize the selection. and it has to put them in the selection. and it has to put them in the selection. and it has to put them in an order and with a spacing that makes an order and with a spacing that makes an order and with a spacing that makes sense. You don't have letters sense. You don't have letters sense. You don't have letters intersecting. One has to follow another intersecting. One has to follow another intersecting. One has to follow another and it has to somehow keep an index of and it has to somehow keep an index of and it has to somehow keep an index of how long down the line I've written. how long down the line I've written. how long down the line I've written. There's kind of like a limitation in geo There's kind of like a limitation in geo There's kind of like a limitation in geo nodes like importer for images. It nodes like importer for images. It nodes like importer for images. It doesn't let you use file paths. So, for doesn't let you use file paths. So, for doesn't let you use file paths. So, for now, I'm just going to use the import now, I'm just going to use the import now, I'm just going to use the import images as planes add-on. If you don't images as planes add-on. If you don't images as planes add-on. If you don't have it enabled, then do that. I'm just have it enabled, then do that. I'm just have it enabled, then do that. I'm just going to select all of these. And going to select all of these. And going to select all of these. And really, the end game is just to have it really, the end game is just to have it really, the end game is just to have it be like an alpha channel thing. I think be like an alpha channel thing. I think be like an alpha channel thing. I think shadeless is what we want. maybe even shadeless is what we want. maybe even shadeless is what we want. maybe even emission. I don't even know. Good enough emission. I don't even know. Good enough emission. I don't even know. Good enough for me. Import images as planes. And for me. Import images as planes. And for me. Import images as planes. And now, not only does it import in all our now, not only does it import in all our now, not only does it import in all our letters, which it does. But notice that letters, which it does. But notice that letters, which it does. But notice that they keep their like relative sizes. And they keep their like relative sizes. And they keep their like relative sizes. And you're going to see a big issue right you're going to see a big issue right you're going to see a big issue right now. But before I address that, uh you now. But before I address that, uh you now. But before I address that, uh you can see the I's are thin, the L's are can see the I's are thin, the L's are can see the I's are thin, the L's are thin, etc., and it goes all the way down thin, etc., and it goes all the way down thin, etc., and it goes all the way down the line. Now, what's the big issue? The the line. Now, what's the big issue? The the line. Now, what's the big issue? The issue is my dumb dumb brain didn't issue is my dumb dumb brain didn't issue is my dumb dumb brain didn't actually write these to scale. So, this actually write these to scale. So, this actually write these to scale. So, this letter A here is much bigger than I letter A here is much bigger than I letter A here is much bigger than I would normally write it compared to the would normally write it compared to the would normally write it compared to the letter D. Kind of that circle here. So, letter D. Kind of that circle here. So, letter D. Kind of that circle here. So, because these aren't relative to scale, because these aren't relative to scale, because these aren't relative to scale, relative to each other, I need to fix relative to each other, I need to fix relative to each other, I need to fix that manually, but it's not a big deal. that manually, but it's not a big deal. that manually, but it's not a big deal. The way I see it is there's two kinds of The way I see it is there's two kinds of The way I see it is there's two kinds of letters. There's like tall letters like letters. There's like tall letters like letters. There's like tall letters like B, D, F, G, whatever. And then there's B, D, F, G, whatever. And then there's B, D, F, G, whatever. And then there's like circular letters like A, C, E. All like circular letters like A, C, E. All like circular letters like A, C, E. All I'm going to do is I'm going to select I'm going to do is I'm going to select I'm going to do is I'm going to select those ones. So, the C's qualify, the E's those ones. So, the C's qualify, the E's those ones. So, the C's qualify, the E's qualify, M's are too big, N's are too qualify, M's are too big, N's are too qualify, M's are too big, N's are too big, O's are too big. Are WX's, not Y, big, O's are too big. Are WX's, not Y, big, O's are too big. Are WX's, not Y, but yes, Z. They're the not tall but yes, Z. They're the not tall but yes, Z. They're the not tall vertical letters. I'm going to hit tab vertical letters. I'm going to hit tab vertical letters. I'm going to hit tab so that I can scale them, but I don't so that I can scale them, but I don't so that I can scale them, but I don't want to scale them as one thing. I want want to scale them as one thing. I want want to scale them as one thing. I want to scale them individually. Individual to scale them individually. Individual to scale them individually. Individual origins is going to allow me to do that. origins is going to allow me to do that. origins is going to allow me to do that. And it looks like I have skipped one of And it looks like I have skipped one of And it looks like I have skipped one of these. So, I just kind of scale it until these. So, I just kind of scale it until these. So, I just kind of scale it until it roughly fits. We can also modify it roughly fits. We can also modify it roughly fits. We can also modify these one by one. So, one of our C's is these one by one. So, one of our C's is these one by one. So, one of our C's is bigger than the other. Yeah, that's bigger than the other. Yeah, that's bigger than the other. Yeah, that's pretty good. I think the only thing pretty good. I think the only thing pretty good. I think the only thing missing is eyes are kind of small missing is eyes are kind of small missing is eyes are kind of small actually, even though they're vertical. actually, even though they're vertical. actually, even though they're vertical. So, let me make those tinier. Now that So, let me make those tinier. Now that So, let me make those tinier. Now that we have our whole thing, one thing I we have our whole thing, one thing I we have our whole thing, one thing I want you to notice, and this is very want you to notice, and this is very want you to notice, and this is very important. You're going to see that this important. You're going to see that this important. You're going to see that this like list of items is in order like list of items is in order like list of items is in order alphabetically, literally, cuz it's the alphabetically, literally, cuz it's the alphabetically, literally, cuz it's the alphabet. And this is going to be alphabet. And this is going to be alphabet. And this is going to be important because when we distinguish important because when we distinguish important because when we distinguish between which one is which, we're going between which one is which, we're going between which one is which, we're going to be looking for its index in the to be looking for its index in the to be looking for its index in the collection. So, if this is not in order, collection. So, if this is not in order, collection. So, if this is not in order, we're going to have a bad time. I'm we're going to have a bad time. I'm we're going to have a bad time. I'm going to close up this collection and going to close up this collection and going to close up this collection and I'm going to call it my alphabet. And we I'm going to call it my alphabet. And we I'm going to call it my alphabet. And we also need a object to be our like geo also need a object to be our like geo also need a object to be our like geo nodes thing. That should be outside the nodes thing. That should be outside the nodes thing. That should be outside the collection. I'll call this our compiler. collection. I'll call this our compiler. collection. I'll call this our compiler. Really, it's our writer. I'm gonna hide Really, it's our writer. I'm gonna hide Really, it's our writer. I'm gonna hide that and I think we're good to go. We that and I think we're good to go. We that and I think we're good to go. We want to make sure that all of these want to make sure that all of these want to make sure that all of these aren't like centered where they are aren't like centered where they are aren't like centered where they are currently. So if I was to draw a line, currently. So if I was to draw a line, currently. So if I was to draw a line, right? So I'm writing on top of this right? So I'm writing on top of this right? So I'm writing on top of this line. You can see these A's are exactly line. You can see these A's are exactly line. You can see these A's are exactly where they should be, but the B's are where they should be, but the B's are where they should be, but the B's are under. And what the freaky is going on under. And what the freaky is going on under. And what the freaky is going on with the C. Some letters dip above or with the C. Some letters dip above or with the C. Some letters dip above or below. So the G's need to be a lot below. So the G's need to be a lot below. So the G's need to be a lot lower. I want to adjust this in a pretty lower. I want to adjust this in a pretty lower. I want to adjust this in a pretty fast way. And for most of these letters, fast way. And for most of these letters, fast way. And for most of these letters, except for the G's, Q's, and P's, the except for the G's, Q's, and P's, the except for the G's, Q's, and P's, the ones that, and J's, the ones that dip ones that, and J's, the ones that dip ones that, and J's, the ones that dip under, I think we want to center it at under, I think we want to center it at under, I think we want to center it at the bottom left corner for each of the bottom left corner for each of the bottom left corner for each of these. We're in geo nodes land, baby. these. We're in geo nodes land, baby. these. We're in geo nodes land, baby. So, that was cringy. So, let's hide our So, that was cringy. So, let's hide our So, that was cringy. So, let's hide our alphabet. Go to my geo nodes area. Get alphabet. Go to my geo nodes area. Get alphabet. Go to my geo nodes area. Get rid of the input and the header. First rid of the input and the header. First rid of the input and the header. First of all, we need to bring in our things. of all, we need to bring in our things. of all, we need to bring in our things. That's going to be our collection. So, That's going to be our collection. So, That's going to be our collection. So, you can make it go into a collection you can make it go into a collection you can make it go into a collection info, but we don't need it. So, just info, but we don't need it. So, just info, but we don't need it. So, just collection info. Bring in our alphabet. collection info. Bring in our alphabet. collection info. Bring in our alphabet. And when we view this, you're going to And when we view this, you're going to And when we view this, you're going to see it brings everything in in the see it brings everything in in the see it brings everything in in the positioning and the ordering that you positioning and the ordering that you positioning and the ordering that you know we had. As we can see in the know we had. As we can see in the know we had. As we can see in the spreadsheet here, we have a single spreadsheet here, we have a single spreadsheet here, we have a single instance. It should not be one instance. instance. It should not be one instance. instance. It should not be one instance. We need 26 letters, 27 with the space We need 26 letters, 27 with the space We need 26 letters, 27 with the space times three instances. So you're going times three instances. So you're going times three instances. So you're going to hit separate children. And now we to hit separate children. And now we to hit separate children. And now we have all of our things with its like have all of our things with its like have all of our things with its like names and our instances. Turns out names and our instances. Turns out names and our instances. Turns out there's 81. And I guess we could also there's 81. And I guess we could also there's 81. And I guess we could also reset the children, which will overlap reset the children, which will overlap reset the children, which will overlap all of them. Now, here you can really all of them. Now, here you can really all of them. Now, here you can really see this issue I'm talking about where see this issue I'm talking about where see this issue I'm talking about where some of the letters are above the line, some of the letters are above the line, some of the letters are above the line, some of them are below it. And our goal some of them are below it. And our goal some of them are below it. And our goal really is for each of these tiles, really is for each of these tiles, really is for each of these tiles, whatever letter it may be, whether it's whatever letter it may be, whether it's whatever letter it may be, whether it's tall or skinny or whatever, we need this tall or skinny or whatever, we need this tall or skinny or whatever, we need this to be centered at like the bottom left to be centered at like the bottom left to be centered at like the bottom left corner. So, right now, it's centered at corner. So, right now, it's centered at corner. So, right now, it's centered at the origin. I just want to shift the origin. I just want to shift the origin. I just want to shift everything up. We don't know how to do everything up. We don't know how to do everything up. We don't know how to do it, but we do know our goal is to it, but we do know our goal is to it, but we do know our goal is to translate our instances. And we just translate our instances. And we just translate our instances. And we just need to find that magical number for need to find that magical number for need to find that magical number for each of these. There's that new node each of these. There's that new node each of these. There's that new node called bounding instance bounds. And called bounding instance bounds. And called bounding instance bounds. And what it does is for each instance what it does is for each instance what it does is for each instance individually, it's a field. It will give individually, it's a field. It will give individually, it's a field. It will give us the minimum and the maximum. The us the minimum and the maximum. The us the minimum and the maximum. The minimum corresponds to the bottom left minimum corresponds to the bottom left minimum corresponds to the bottom left corner. I believe if I was to translate corner. I believe if I was to translate corner. I believe if I was to translate each instance by its individual minimum, each instance by its individual minimum, each instance by its individual minimum, you can see now they are all like you can see now they are all like you can see now they are all like centered at the top right corner. Why is centered at the top right corner. Why is centered at the top right corner. Why is that the case? If I have my tile over that the case? If I have my tile over that the case? If I have my tile over here that's centered and I look at its here that's centered and I look at its here that's centered and I look at its minimum, if I offset by this minimum, minimum, if I offset by this minimum, minimum, if I offset by this minimum, it's going to shove it this way. Really, it's going to shove it this way. Really, it's going to shove it this way. Really, what I want to do is the opposite. I what I want to do is the opposite. I what I want to do is the opposite. I want to take this bottom left corner and want to take this bottom left corner and want to take this bottom left corner and make it the origin. So, you might make it the origin. So, you might make it the origin. So, you might already know all we need to do is run already know all we need to do is run already know all we need to do is run that vector math where we invert. We that vector math where we invert. We that vector math where we invert. We multiply by negative 1 and beautiful. multiply by negative 1 and beautiful. multiply by negative 1 and beautiful. Now, they are all where they need to be. Now, they are all where they need to be. Now, they are all where they need to be. But again, there is a tiny bit of a But again, there is a tiny bit of a But again, there is a tiny bit of a problem. It's the special letters, the problem. It's the special letters, the problem. It's the special letters, the Y's, the P's, the ones that dip under Y's, the P's, the ones that dip under Y's, the P's, the ones that dip under our writing line. And we could move our writing line. And we could move our writing line. And we could move those down using geo nodes, but I think those down using geo nodes, but I think those down using geo nodes, but I think this is the kind of thing that's easier this is the kind of thing that's easier this is the kind of thing that's easier to do manually. So, another new operator to do manually. So, another new operator to do manually. So, another new operator that will help us with this is if we that will help us with this is if we that will help us with this is if we select our geometry nodes and hit Ctrl select our geometry nodes and hit Ctrl select our geometry nodes and hit Ctrl A, there's a new operator called visual A, there's a new operator called visual A, there's a new operator called visual geometry to objects. When I click it, geometry to objects. When I click it, geometry to objects. When I click it, you're going to see it has this special you're going to see it has this special you're going to see it has this special property where it made all these property where it made all these property where it made all these collections and all of these objects. collections and all of these objects. collections and all of these objects. It's now taken our things with the It's now taken our things with the It's now taken our things with the transforms, but made them each of them a transforms, but made them each of them a transforms, but made them each of them a separate instance, a separate object, separate instance, a separate object, separate instance, a separate object, which is exactly what we want. I'm going which is exactly what we want. I'm going which is exactly what we want. I'm going to take our writer that is right there to take our writer that is right there to take our writer that is right there in the middle of the alphabet and I'm in the middle of the alphabet and I'm in the middle of the alphabet and I'm going to put it in a new collection going to put it in a new collection going to put it in a new collection called writer to be more organized and called writer to be more organized and called writer to be more organized and so that we don't see it here. We can so that we don't see it here. We can so that we don't see it here. We can take all of these like instant instanced take all of these like instant instanced take all of these like instant instanced collections or whatever and this time I collections or whatever and this time I collections or whatever and this time I believe Ctrl+ A and now make instances believe Ctrl+ A and now make instances believe Ctrl+ A and now make instances real. So now these are all objects and real. So now these are all objects and real. So now these are all objects and the empties are separate. I'm going to the empties are separate. I'm going to the empties are separate. I'm going to also select our writer which is the geo also select our writer which is the geo also select our writer which is the geo nodes. Ctrl I to invert and select nodes. Ctrl I to invert and select nodes. Ctrl I to invert and select everything else and delete it I believe. everything else and delete it I believe. everything else and delete it I believe. And now all of these collections, I And now all of these collections, I And now all of these collections, I don't know what they represent to be don't know what they represent to be don't know what they represent to be honest. If I take all of these empty, honest. If I take all of these empty, honest. If I take all of these empty, well, they're not empty. I take all of well, they're not empty. I take all of well, they're not empty. I take all of these collections, I rightclick, and I these collections, I rightclick, and I these collections, I rightclick, and I delete hierarchy. That should have delete hierarchy. That should have delete hierarchy. That should have gotten rid of them. Okay, so the only gotten rid of them. Okay, so the only gotten rid of them. Okay, so the only objects we have is our instances that objects we have is our instances that objects we have is our instances that are now well positioned, and we can are now well positioned, and we can are now well positioned, and we can align them. So, I'm going to call it align them. So, I'm going to call it align them. So, I'm going to call it corner alphabet or something. We have corner alphabet or something. We have corner alphabet or something. We have our corner alphabet that has 81 objects. our corner alphabet that has 81 objects. our corner alphabet that has 81 objects. We have our writer, that's the geonotes, We have our writer, that's the geonotes, We have our writer, that's the geonotes, and then we have our good old alphabet and then we have our good old alphabet and then we have our good old alphabet that we no longer need, but I'll keep it that we no longer need, but I'll keep it that we no longer need, but I'll keep it around. So now the name of the game around. So now the name of the game around. So now the name of the game really is to figure out which letters really is to figure out which letters really is to figure out which letters need to go down. And that is pretty need to go down. And that is pretty need to go down. And that is pretty simple because I know which letters simple because I know which letters simple because I know which letters those should be. Well, I can actually those should be. Well, I can actually those should be. Well, I can actually just look at my sheet here. So looking just look at my sheet here. So looking just look at my sheet here. So looking at this, the first ones are the G's at this, the first ones are the G's at this, the first ones are the G's followed by the J's should also be followed by the J's should also be followed by the J's should also be beneath. The P's and the Q's and then beneath. The P's and the Q's and then beneath. The P's and the Q's and then the Y's. And that should be it. All of the Y's. And that should be it. All of the Y's. And that should be it. All of these should be lower. So I'm just going these should be lower. So I'm just going these should be lower. So I'm just going to shift these down like that. So to shift these down like that. So to shift these down like that. So they're right on the line. And now they're right on the line. And now they're right on the line. And now they're all centered where they need to they're all centered where they need to they're all centered where they need to be. I can hide the corner alphabet and be. I can hide the corner alphabet and be. I can hide the corner alphabet and now we construct words. Okay, we've done now we construct words. Okay, we've done now we construct words. Okay, we've done it. So, as I have mentioned or at least it. So, as I have mentioned or at least it. So, as I have mentioned or at least will mention, a lot of the nodes in this will mention, a lot of the nodes in this will mention, a lot of the nodes in this tutorial are going to be available free tutorial are going to be available free tutorial are going to be available free at cgmatter.com. A website made with at cgmatter.com. A website made with at cgmatter.com. A website made with Squarespace. So, why do I choose Squarespace. So, why do I choose Squarespace. So, why do I choose Squarespace to host and make my website Squarespace to host and make my website Squarespace to host and make my website for the use case I'm going for, it's an for the use case I'm going for, it's an for the use case I'm going for, it's an obvious choice. The first thing that is obvious choice. The first thing that is obvious choice. The first thing that is huge is Squarespace payments. All the huge is Squarespace payments. All the huge is Squarespace payments. All the logistics of selling and having logistics of selling and having logistics of selling and having recurring subscriptions is handled by recurring subscriptions is handled by recurring subscriptions is handled by them. Payments right on there. Second of them. Payments right on there. Second of them. Payments right on there. Second of all, you have an asset browser, which is all, you have an asset browser, which is all, you have an asset browser, which is important because I have like photos, I important because I have like photos, I important because I have like photos, I have videos, and I have blend files in have videos, and I have blend files in have videos, and I have blend files in my uh posts in the member only area. And my uh posts in the member only area. And my uh posts in the member only area. And then thirdly, I was actually recently then thirdly, I was actually recently then thirdly, I was actually recently writing some documentation for the writing some documentation for the writing some documentation for the camera tracker update, and I found that camera tracker update, and I found that camera tracker update, and I found that the built-in Squarespace AI stuff is the built-in Squarespace AI stuff is the built-in Squarespace AI stuff is very intuitive in finishing your very intuitive in finishing your very intuitive in finishing your sentences, kind of knowing what you sentences, kind of knowing what you sentences, kind of knowing what you meant. I went in there, I did a second meant. I went in there, I did a second meant. I went in there, I did a second pass to be like, "Oh, here's something a pass to be like, "Oh, here's something a pass to be like, "Oh, here's something a bit more specific." And the great thing bit more specific." And the great thing bit more specific." And the great thing is you can try Squarespace. Make your is you can try Squarespace. Make your is you can try Squarespace. Make your own website. And when you're ready to own website. And when you're ready to own website. And when you're ready to launch, use this link below in the launch, use this link below in the launch, use this link below in the description to save 10% off your first description to save 10% off your first description to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or a domain. I'm purchase of a website or a domain. I'm purchase of a website or a domain. I'm going to add a new object. This one, going to add a new object. This one, going to add a new object. This one, what should I name this? Well, the what should I name this? Well, the what should I name this? Well, the writer, I mean, this new one should be writer, I mean, this new one should be writer, I mean, this new one should be the writer. So, maybe we can call this the writer. So, maybe we can call this the writer. So, maybe we can call this the aggregator. I don't even know. This the aggregator. I don't even know. This the aggregator. I don't even know. This one can be the writer. And then this one can be the writer. And then this one can be the writer. And then this needs its own geometry nodes. Just like needs its own geometry nodes. Just like needs its own geometry nodes. Just like before, we're going to import in our before, we're going to import in our before, we're going to import in our collection this time of the corner collection this time of the corner collection this time of the corner alphabet that is positioned where it alphabet that is positioned where it alphabet that is positioned where it needs to be. You can see that once again needs to be. You can see that once again needs to be. You can see that once again this is a single instance. I don't want this is a single instance. I don't want this is a single instance. I don't want that. I want to separate children. So that. I want to separate children. So that. I want to separate children. So now I have all of my 81 letters. I think now I have all of my 81 letters. I think now I have all of my 81 letters. I think I forgot to put the origin at world I forgot to put the origin at world I forgot to put the origin at world cursor which is what we were supposed to cursor which is what we were supposed to cursor which is what we were supposed to do. But there's a very easy way to clear do. But there's a very easy way to clear do. But there's a very easy way to clear these positions so that they stay where these positions so that they stay where these positions so that they stay where they are but their position is zero. To they are but their position is zero. To they are but their position is zero. To do that I'm going to make them no longer do that I'm going to make them no longer do that I'm going to make them no longer instances. I'm going to realize instances. I'm going to realize instances. I'm going to realize instances. So now these are all going to instances. So now these are all going to instances. So now these are all going to be faces but they're going to be in the be faces but they're going to be in the be faces but they're going to be in the exact same order which is what is going exact same order which is what is going exact same order which is what is going to let us bring it back into instances. to let us bring it back into instances. to let us bring it back into instances. So got rid of the data. bringing it back So got rid of the data. bringing it back So got rid of the data. bringing it back to instances and to separate them they to instances and to separate them they to instances and to separate them they need to be separated by index for the need to be separated by index for the need to be separated by index for the faces. So now once again we have a one faces. So now once again we have a one faces. So now once again we have a one of these and just to verify that of these and just to verify that of these and just to verify that everything is in the correct order I'm everything is in the correct order I'm everything is in the correct order I'm going to run a separate by index which going to run a separate by index which going to run a separate by index which is a node I made and you can get for is a node I made and you can get for is a node I made and you can get for free. You don't need to be a website free. You don't need to be a website free. You don't need to be a website member although I encourage you to be. member although I encourage you to be. member although I encourage you to be. This is going to let us separate by in This is going to let us separate by in This is going to let us separate by in this case instance and I can go through this case instance and I can go through this case instance and I can go through these. So the first three should be these. So the first three should be these. So the first three should be empty. The next three should be A's and empty. The next three should be A's and empty. The next three should be A's and then B's and they're all the correct then B's and they're all the correct then B's and they're all the correct size. C Let's write a word. So I'm going size. C Let's write a word. So I'm going size. C Let's write a word. So I'm going to make a string. That string can say to make a string. That string can say to make a string. That string can say something like CG matter, which isn't something like CG matter, which isn't something like CG matter, which isn't only a good word in general in this only a good word in general in this only a good word in general in this world, but it has two T's over here, world, but it has two T's over here, world, but it has two T's over here, which is going to let me test that which is going to let me test that which is going to let me test that randomization of can you pick different randomization of can you pick different randomization of can you pick different T's or whatever. For each letter, one by T's or whatever. For each letter, one by T's or whatever. For each letter, one by one, it needs to detect what letter it one, it needs to detect what letter it one, it needs to detect what letter it is and bring in the corresponding is and bring in the corresponding is and bring in the corresponding instance. Now, this is a operation for instance. Now, this is a operation for instance. Now, this is a operation for the repeat zone cuz I want to repeat the repeat zone cuz I want to repeat the repeat zone cuz I want to repeat going down the line. I forgot I was going down the line. I forgot I was going down the line. I forgot I was using 4.5. We're in 5.0. I just like the using 4.5. We're in 5.0. I just like the using 4.5. We're in 5.0. I just like the look of it. So, what was I saying? I was look of it. So, what was I saying? I was look of it. So, what was I saying? I was saying we're going to take all of this. saying we're going to take all of this. saying we're going to take all of this. We're going to control G make that a We're going to control G make that a We're going to control G make that a node group alphabet, right? It's just node group alphabet, right? It's just node group alphabet, right? It's just like a list of instances. And now we can like a list of instances. And now we can like a list of instances. And now we can run a repeat operation where it's going run a repeat operation where it's going run a repeat operation where it's going to separate letter by letter and bring to separate letter by letter and bring to separate letter by letter and bring in the correct instance. We are going to in the correct instance. We are going to in the correct instance. We are going to loop over the string. And each um loop over the string. And each um loop over the string. And each um iteration, the string is going to stay iteration, the string is going to stay iteration, the string is going to stay the same. So I'm just going to feed it the same. So I'm just going to feed it the same. So I'm just going to feed it into itself. And the number of into itself. And the number of into itself. And the number of iterations is going to be the number of iterations is going to be the number of iterations is going to be the number of letters cuz we need to go letter by letters cuz we need to go letter by letters cuz we need to go letter by letter. So let's do a string length. letter. So let's do a string length. letter. So let's do a string length. That'll tell me exactly how many letters That'll tell me exactly how many letters That'll tell me exactly how many letters and therefore how many iterations to go and therefore how many iterations to go and therefore how many iterations to go through. And then for each iteration I through. And then for each iteration I through. And then for each iteration I need to figure out which like index is need to figure out which like index is need to figure out which like index is the letter C, the letter G, the letter the letter C, the letter G, the letter the letter C, the letter G, the letter M. So if we just like write the alphabet M. So if we just like write the alphabet M. So if we just like write the alphabet like in a column generally you might be like in a column generally you might be like in a column generally you might be like okay A is 1, B is 2, C is 3 etc. like okay A is 1, B is 2, C is 3 etc. like okay A is 1, B is 2, C is 3 etc. Although the only difference is now Although the only difference is now Although the only difference is now there are actually three A's and three there are actually three A's and three there are actually three A's and three B's and three C's cuz we made those B's and three C's cuz we made those B's and three C's cuz we made those variants. You can think of A as being variants. You can think of A as being variants. You can think of A as being like 1 through 3 or like 0 to two like 1 through 3 or like 0 to two like 1 through 3 or like 0 to two whatever you want to call it. B is going whatever you want to call it. B is going whatever you want to call it. B is going to be 4 to 6 and yada yada. Uh that's to be 4 to 6 and yada yada. Uh that's to be 4 to 6 and yada yada. Uh that's what we need to capture. If I type in what we need to capture. If I type in what we need to capture. If I type in the alphabet just in order A B CDE E F G the alphabet just in order A B CDE E F G the alphabet just in order A B CDE E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z and maybe let's also add a space at the and maybe let's also add a space at the and maybe let's also add a space at the very beginning. So that's going to very beginning. So that's going to very beginning. So that's going to represent like the zero with the space represent like the zero with the space represent like the zero with the space letter. I can then take each letter and letter. I can then take each letter and letter. I can then take each letter and compare it to the string and say where compare it to the string and say where compare it to the string and say where is it in here there is a like find in is it in here there is a like find in is it in here there is a like find in string. I bring in my string. I say what string. I bring in my string. I say what string. I bring in my string. I say what is it that I want to search and then it is it that I want to search and then it is it that I want to search and then it will give me the index of where it found will give me the index of where it found will give me the index of where it found it. We need to separate this out to its it. We need to separate this out to its it. We need to separate this out to its first letter and that can be done using first letter and that can be done using first letter and that can be done using a slice string. So many string nodes a slice string. So many string nodes a slice string. So many string nodes that we haven't really played with. I'm that we haven't really played with. I'm that we haven't really played with. I'm going to bring in our string and then going to bring in our string and then going to bring in our string and then for each iteration I want to say look at for each iteration I want to say look at for each iteration I want to say look at the iteration as the position. So maybe the iteration as the position. So maybe the iteration as the position. So maybe position one is C, position 2 is G, yada position one is C, position 2 is G, yada position one is C, position 2 is G, yada yada yada and only keep the first one. yada yada and only keep the first one. yada yada and only keep the first one. So if for like CG matter I was at So if for like CG matter I was at So if for like CG matter I was at position two which represents G. The position two which represents G. The position two which represents G. The length is how many letters am I going to length is how many letters am I going to length is how many letters am I going to keep after that? So if it's a length of keep after that? So if it's a length of keep after that? So if it's a length of one it's just going to be G. If it's a one it's just going to be G. If it's a one it's just going to be G. If it's a length of two, it's going to be the G length of two, it's going to be the G length of two, it's going to be the G and the M. So, where do we start and how and the M. So, where do we start and how and the M. So, where do we start and how many uh do we go down? Of course, we many uh do we go down? Of course, we many uh do we go down? Of course, we only want a length of one because we only want a length of one because we only want a length of one because we only want that letter. This is what I'm only want that letter. This is what I'm only want that letter. This is what I'm going to search for. So, we're going to going to search for. So, we're going to going to search for. So, we're going to find where is it in this thing. This is find where is it in this thing. This is find where is it in this thing. This is going to be the index. And then we do going to be the index. And then we do going to be the index. And then we do that multiply by three situation. I that multiply by three situation. I that multiply by three situation. I guess we have integer math. Take the guess we have integer math. Take the guess we have integer math. Take the index, you multiply by three. We might index, you multiply by three. We might index, you multiply by three. We might need to add one somewhere. I don't even need to add one somewhere. I don't even need to add one somewhere. I don't even know. And then for this, remember the know. And then for this, remember the know. And then for this, remember the name of the game was uh bringing in that name of the game was uh bringing in that name of the game was uh bringing in that instance, whatever it may be. And we'll instance, whatever it may be. And we'll instance, whatever it may be. And we'll also add that like can it pick a also add that like can it pick a also add that like can it pick a different variation in a moment. I just different variation in a moment. I just different variation in a moment. I just want to see generally does this work. So want to see generally does this work. So want to see generally does this work. So for the alphabet I'm going to use that for the alphabet I'm going to use that for the alphabet I'm going to use that separate by index again that's on my separate by index again that's on my separate by index again that's on my website for free. We are going to take website for free. We are going to take website for free. We are going to take this and separate the instance such that this and separate the instance such that this and separate the instance such that it is equal to whatever this is. So it's it is equal to whatever this is. So it's it is equal to whatever this is. So it's going to output like the instance of C going to output like the instance of C going to output like the instance of C or G or M whatever. I want to join it or G or M whatever. I want to join it or G or M whatever. I want to join it with everything that it did before. So with everything that it did before. So with everything that it did before. So I'll explain this right now. We start I'll explain this right now. We start I'll explain this right now. We start off with a target string. In this case off with a target string. In this case off with a target string. In this case it's CG matter. I take the length of it it's CG matter. I take the length of it it's CG matter. I take the length of it to say how many letters do I need to to say how many letters do I need to to say how many letters do I need to process and then for each iteration I'm process and then for each iteration I'm process and then for each iteration I'm going to take position 1 2 3 basically going to take position 1 2 3 basically going to take position 1 2 3 basically this iteration this index I'm going to this iteration this index I'm going to this iteration this index I'm going to keep only that letter nothing beyond keep only that letter nothing beyond keep only that letter nothing beyond that and then I'm going to find it that and then I'm going to find it that and then I'm going to find it inside of our alphabet including a space inside of our alphabet including a space inside of our alphabet including a space it's going to tell us where in that it's going to tell us where in that it's going to tell us where in that string is it going to be and then string is it going to be and then string is it going to be and then because we have three variations I because we have three variations I because we have three variations I multiply by three and pull in that multiply by three and pull in that multiply by three and pull in that index. So this may be wrong but let's do index. So this may be wrong but let's do index. So this may be wrong but let's do a big reveal. I'm going to do this and I a big reveal. I'm going to do this and I a big reveal. I'm going to do this and I mean it kind of looks right. There's a mean it kind of looks right. There's a mean it kind of looks right. There's a T. There's a G. Never mind that they're T. There's a G. Never mind that they're T. There's a G. Never mind that they're all overlapping. I think it's bringing all overlapping. I think it's bringing all overlapping. I think it's bringing in the right letters. What we can do is in the right letters. What we can do is in the right letters. What we can do is we can take the letters and for each we can take the letters and for each we can take the letters and for each iteration, I'm just going to shift them iteration, I'm just going to shift them iteration, I'm just going to shift them to the side. Eventually, we need to to the side. Eventually, we need to to the side. Eventually, we need to figure out what that perfect amount is. figure out what that perfect amount is. figure out what that perfect amount is. But for now, I'm just going to transform But for now, I'm just going to transform But for now, I'm just going to transform geometry. And that translation, where am geometry. And that translation, where am geometry. And that translation, where am I moving them? That can just be the uh I moving them? That can just be the uh I moving them? That can just be the uh iteration or index. So, we have CG M A T iteration or index. So, we have CG M A T iteration or index. So, we have CG M A T E R. And notice that these T's are E R. And notice that these T's are E R. And notice that these T's are identical, which is what we expect. It's identical, which is what we expect. It's identical, which is what we expect. It's pulling in the exact same one. Well, if pulling in the exact same one. Well, if pulling in the exact same one. Well, if we have three values of t, I believe we have three values of t, I believe we have three values of t, I believe right now we're always sampling the right now we're always sampling the right now we're always sampling the first one, but I want the chance to first one, but I want the chance to first one, but I want the chance to offset by one or offset by two. So, it offset by one or offset by two. So, it offset by one or offset by two. So, it can pick a variation. What is that can pick a variation. What is that can pick a variation. What is that variation going to be? Well, all I need variation going to be? Well, all I need variation going to be? Well, all I need to do is I need to add a random value. to do is I need to add a random value. to do is I need to add a random value. And maybe this could be integer math. It And maybe this could be integer math. It And maybe this could be integer math. It really doesn't matter. Add a random really doesn't matter. Add a random really doesn't matter. Add a random value. That random value has to be a value. That random value has to be a value. That random value has to be a integer between zero and two. If it's integer between zero and two. If it's integer between zero and two. If it's zero, it's saying pick the first. If zero, it's saying pick the first. If zero, it's saying pick the first. If it's one, offset by one, offset by two. it's one, offset by one, offset by two. it's one, offset by one, offset by two. connect this over here which you can see connect this over here which you can see connect this over here which you can see changed things a little and it also changed things a little and it also changed things a little and it also broke things a little and I think we broke things a little and I think we broke things a little and I think we must have like have the index like must have like have the index like must have like have the index like shifted by one which is why letters are shifted by one which is why letters are shifted by one which is why letters are you know phasing in and out but either you know phasing in and out but either you know phasing in and out but either way I want to make sure either the seed way I want to make sure either the seed way I want to make sure either the seed or the ID is different each time what or the ID is different each time what or the ID is different each time what happens if we take our iteration and happens if we take our iteration and happens if we take our iteration and make the seed different versus ID so now make the seed different versus ID so now make the seed different versus ID so now you can see in some cases we get you can see in some cases we get you can see in some cases we get different T's that aren't identical as I different T's that aren't identical as I different T's that aren't identical as I change the seed we get a flickering of change the seed we get a flickering of change the seed we get a flickering of the letters where it chooses the right the letters where it chooses the right the letters where it chooses the right one but maybe a different instance of it one but maybe a different instance of it one but maybe a different instance of it beautiful I think it's time to clean beautiful I think it's time to clean beautiful I think it's time to clean clean up shop. All of this stuff that clean up shop. All of this stuff that clean up shop. All of this stuff that essentially selects the uh string can be essentially selects the uh string can be essentially selects the uh string can be a node group. And because we're using a node group. And because we're using a node group. And because we're using this input multiple times, select all of this input multiple times, select all of this input multiple times, select all of this. Ctrl G. And then we can call this this. Ctrl G. And then we can call this this. Ctrl G. And then we can call this our I guess our like index finder or our our I guess our like index finder or our our I guess our like index finder or our position finder. The input is going to position finder. The input is going to position finder. The input is going to be the iteration, which I'm just going be the iteration, which I'm just going be the iteration, which I'm just going to make it nice and readable. That's to make it nice and readable. That's to make it nice and readable. That's been one of my new hobbies. Kind of a been one of my new hobbies. Kind of a been one of my new hobbies. Kind of a strong word, but I've been trying to strong word, but I've been trying to strong word, but I've been trying to organize my files a bit better, organize my files a bit better, organize my files a bit better, especially since I'm going to ultimately especially since I'm going to ultimately especially since I'm going to ultimately share them this part right here. So, we share them this part right here. So, we share them this part right here. So, we have our index finder. This part right have our index finder. This part right have our index finder. This part right here is going to be our like letter here is going to be our like letter here is going to be our like letter selector, I guess. So, letter selector. selector, I guess. So, letter selector. selector, I guess. So, letter selector. And then we have our transform geometry, And then we have our transform geometry, And then we have our transform geometry, which right now doesn't make any sense. which right now doesn't make any sense. which right now doesn't make any sense. They're just going diagonally. So, I'm They're just going diagonally. So, I'm They're just going diagonally. So, I'm going to get rid of that for now. I'm going to get rid of that for now. I'm going to get rid of that for now. I'm going to select all of this. CtrlG. And going to select all of this. CtrlG. And going to select all of this. CtrlG. And this could be called Well, what does it this could be called Well, what does it this could be called Well, what does it do? It basically takes in a string and do? It basically takes in a string and do? It basically takes in a string and it outputs all of those instances. So it outputs all of those instances. So it outputs all of those instances. So maybe we'll call this gather instances maybe we'll call this gather instances maybe we'll call this gather instances or maybe gather letters which in here we or maybe gather letters which in here we or maybe gather letters which in here we can specify that this is a instance can specify that this is a instance can specify that this is a instance output with a input of a string. So now output with a input of a string. So now output with a input of a string. So now the last task really is we need these the last task really is we need these the last task really is we need these letters to go one after another which letters to go one after another which letters to go one after another which isn't as obvious as saying translate by isn't as obvious as saying translate by isn't as obvious as saying translate by like 2 every single iteration because like 2 every single iteration because like 2 every single iteration because some letters as you can see here are some letters as you can see here are some letters as you can see here are skinnier longer than others. So this M skinnier longer than others. So this M skinnier longer than others. So this M that you can barely see from CG matter that you can barely see from CG matter that you can barely see from CG matter is longer than the G is going to be for is longer than the G is going to be for is longer than the G is going to be for example. It needs to detect like the example. It needs to detect like the example. It needs to detect like the horizontal length of each of these and horizontal length of each of these and horizontal length of each of these and then say put one after another then then say put one after another then then say put one after another then calculate the whole length. Put one calculate the whole length. Put one calculate the whole length. Put one after another. Calculate the whole after another. Calculate the whole after another. Calculate the whole length. Blender veterans geo nodes length. Blender veterans geo nodes length. Blender veterans geo nodes veterans will know I just describe the veterans will know I just describe the veterans will know I just describe the accumulate field node. What it does is accumulate field node. What it does is accumulate field node. What it does is it adds things. What it adds is up to it adds things. What it adds is up to it adds things. What it adds is up to us. And in this case what I want to add us. And in this case what I want to add us. And in this case what I want to add is if I have a letter what is its is if I have a letter what is its is if I have a letter what is its horizontal width? Well, width is always horizontal width? Well, width is always horizontal width? Well, width is always horizontal because these are instances. horizontal because these are instances. horizontal because these are instances. Again, I'm going to use that instance Again, I'm going to use that instance Again, I'm going to use that instance bounds node. Very useful. I'm going to bounds node. Very useful. I'm going to bounds node. Very useful. I'm going to take the minimum or no, the maximum take the minimum or no, the maximum take the minimum or no, the maximum minus the minimum. So, I'm going to minus the minimum. So, I'm going to minus the minimum. So, I'm going to subtract these. The way you want to subtract these. The way you want to subtract these. The way you want to interpret this is there is a maximum top interpret this is there is a maximum top interpret this is there is a maximum top right corner. There's a minimum. This right corner. There's a minimum. This right corner. There's a minimum. This vector goes from one to the other. And vector goes from one to the other. And vector goes from one to the other. And if I just look at its like x component, if I just look at its like x component, if I just look at its like x component, I project it down here. That is the I project it down here. That is the I project it down here. That is the width. We're going to separate the x width. We're going to separate the x width. We're going to separate the x component. This is what I want to add. component. This is what I want to add. component. This is what I want to add. But what am I adding? I'm adding over But what am I adding? I'm adding over But what am I adding? I'm adding over instances. That was not what I meant to instances. That was not what I meant to instances. That was not what I meant to do. we're adding over instances. And now do. we're adding over instances. And now do. we're adding over instances. And now what this accumulate field will let us what this accumulate field will let us what this accumulate field will let us do is it doesn't just tell us the total, do is it doesn't just tell us the total, do is it doesn't just tell us the total, but it has this leading and trailing but it has this leading and trailing but it has this leading and trailing thing. I don't remember which is which, thing. I don't remember which is which, thing. I don't remember which is which, but this is basically going to say what but this is basically going to say what but this is basically going to say what is our progress as we add these is our progress as we add these is our progress as we add these instances. So I'm going to take instances. So I'm going to take instances. So I'm going to take something that can take in a field like something that can take in a field like something that can take in a field like translate instances. Now this can be translate instances. Now this can be translate instances. Now this can be different depending on the index. So different depending on the index. So different depending on the index. So that's how we got our diagonal thing. that's how we got our diagonal thing. that's how we got our diagonal thing. These are inverted. We'll think about These are inverted. We'll think about These are inverted. We'll think about that later. And that translation should that later. And that translation should that later. And that translation should only be on the X component. So I'm going only be on the X component. So I'm going only be on the X component. So I'm going to say this is our translation. And then to say this is our translation. And then to say this is our translation. And then the X component. It's either leading or the X component. It's either leading or the X component. It's either leading or trailing. I never remember. So leading trailing. I never remember. So leading trailing. I never remember. So leading does that. What about trailing? It is does that. What about trailing? It is does that. What about trailing? It is inverted. It is. And we'll fix that. But inverted. It is. And we'll fix that. But inverted. It is. And we'll fix that. But like you can see exactly where one like you can see exactly where one like you can see exactly where one letter ends. The next one begins. letter ends. The next one begins. letter ends. The next one begins. Amazing. And if I was to change this, so Amazing. And if I was to change this, so Amazing. And if I was to change this, so I bring in a different string like I bring in a different string like I bring in a different string like default. I haven't tested out the space. default. I haven't tested out the space. default. I haven't tested out the space. So this is a good time to do that. So this is a good time to do that. So this is a good time to do that. Default cube. Amazing. Default space Default cube. Amazing. Default space Default cube. Amazing. Default space cube. And at this point you might be cube. And at this point you might be cube. And at this point you might be thinking, is it opposite day? Should I thinking, is it opposite day? Should I thinking, is it opposite day? Should I mirror this whole video? There are two mirror this whole video? There are two mirror this whole video? There are two solutions to this. So one obvious solutions to this. So one obvious solutions to this. So one obvious solution is to write this backwards. So solution is to write this backwards. So solution is to write this backwards. So instead of default cube it would be instead of default cube it would be instead of default cube it would be ubebeck. I got to turn on my brain for ubebeck. I got to turn on my brain for ubebeck. I got to turn on my brain for this one. T L A no TLF. This is so hard. this one. T L A no TLF. This is so hard. this one. T L A no TLF. This is so hard. Okay default cube. So one thing we can Okay default cube. So one thing we can Okay default cube. So one thing we can do is we can invert the string which do is we can invert the string which do is we can invert the string which sounds pretty stupid but I do believe I sounds pretty stupid but I do believe I sounds pretty stupid but I do believe I made a node for this. So is it reverse made a node for this. So is it reverse made a node for this. So is it reverse string? I do have a node for this and string? I do have a node for this and string? I do have a node for this and this will work. How are you doing? But this will work. How are you doing? But this will work. How are you doing? But uh kind of like a more obvious solution uh kind of like a more obvious solution uh kind of like a more obvious solution is before we do this accumulation is before we do this accumulation is before we do this accumulation whatever we need to take these instances whatever we need to take these instances whatever we need to take these instances that go through one to well whatever we that go through one to well whatever we that go through one to well whatever we have as many instances as we do and we have as many instances as we do and we have as many instances as we do and we want to take their indexing and flip it want to take their indexing and flip it want to take their indexing and flip it so it starts with the last one first. so it starts with the last one first. so it starts with the last one first. Good old sort elements node coming to Good old sort elements node coming to Good old sort elements node coming to the rescue. Before I do that however we the rescue. Before I do that however we the rescue. Before I do that however we do have another node group available to do have another node group available to do have another node group available to us. So I'm just going to select all of us. So I'm just going to select all of us. So I'm just going to select all of this G. This is going to be like our gap this G. This is going to be like our gap this G. This is going to be like our gap compiler or something. What about compiler or something. What about compiler or something. What about translator? Something like that. And now translator? Something like that. And now translator? Something like that. And now all we need to do is we have a string, all we need to do is we have a string, all we need to do is we have a string, we gathered all the letters, we we gathered all the letters, we we gathered all the letters, we translate it, but it doesn't like translate it, but it doesn't like translate it, but it doesn't like translate it like Google translate. translate it like Google translate. translate it like Google translate. Okay, positioning. And what's the point? Okay, positioning. And what's the point? Okay, positioning. And what's the point? The point is we need to reverse these. The point is we need to reverse these. The point is we need to reverse these. So by default, the way this works is it So by default, the way this works is it So by default, the way this works is it takes in some sort weight. So that tells takes in some sort weight. So that tells takes in some sort weight. So that tells you what am I using to list these. So by you what am I using to list these. So by you what am I using to list these. So by default, it essentially you can think of default, it essentially you can think of default, it essentially you can think of it as using the index. So if the index it as using the index. So if the index it as using the index. So if the index is you know 1 2 3 etc. It will use that is you know 1 2 3 etc. It will use that is you know 1 2 3 etc. It will use that order to again make a 1 2 3 etc. So, order to again make a 1 2 3 etc. So, order to again make a 1 2 3 etc. So, what if instead of going 1 2 3, we take what if instead of going 1 2 3, we take what if instead of going 1 2 3, we take these and we just multiply them by - 1. these and we just multiply them by - 1. these and we just multiply them by - 1. So, instead of 1 2 3, it's going to be - So, instead of 1 2 3, it's going to be - So, instead of 1 2 3, it's going to be - 1 -2 -3. Well, it wants to go from 1 -2 -3. Well, it wants to go from 1 -2 -3. Well, it wants to go from smallest to largest, which means it's smallest to largest, which means it's smallest to largest, which means it's going to start all the way here at like going to start all the way here at like going to start all the way here at like -12 and then work its way upwards. That -12 and then work its way upwards. That -12 and then work its way upwards. That is a uh reverse. So, that's super easy is a uh reverse. So, that's super easy is a uh reverse. So, that's super easy to do. Multiply by 1 and there you go. to do. Multiply by 1 and there you go. to do. Multiply by 1 and there you go. Let's take all this, make it a group. Let's take all this, make it a group. Let's take all this, make it a group. I'm going to call this, you know, I'm going to call this, you know, I'm going to call this, you know, reverse reverse or maybe reverse order. reverse reverse or maybe reverse order. reverse reverse or maybe reverse order. At the end of all my tutorials, OG At the end of all my tutorials, OG At the end of all my tutorials, OG people will know I always said I've and people will know I always said I've and people will know I always said I've and notice I'm not using this apostrophe, notice I'm not using this apostrophe, notice I'm not using this apostrophe, nor am I using capital letters because nor am I using capital letters because nor am I using capital letters because we do not have that covered, but we do not have that covered, but we do not have that covered, but whatever. So, I've There we go. Been whatever. So, I've There we go. Been whatever. So, I've There we go. Been okay, let's just do it all. I've been CG okay, let's just do it all. I've been CG okay, let's just do it all. I've been CG matter. You've been you. Goodbye. Now, matter. You've been you. Goodbye. Now, matter. You've been you. Goodbye. Now, this is kind of surreal to me because I this is kind of surreal to me because I this is kind of surreal to me because I know my my own handwriting and this is know my my own handwriting and this is know my my own handwriting and this is what it would look like. And to see it what it would look like. And to see it what it would look like. And to see it in like perspective, cuz right now we in like perspective, cuz right now we in like perspective, cuz right now we have this background and it just kind of have this background and it just kind of have this background and it just kind of looks jagged. I'm going to turn off looks jagged. I'm going to turn off looks jagged. I'm going to turn off overlays and let's make the background overlays and let's make the background overlays and let's make the background that we're seeing, we can make that that we're seeing, we can make that that we're seeing, we can make that white. So, in the properties or in the white. So, in the properties or in the white. So, in the properties or in the shading, I'm going to do the properties. shading, I'm going to do the properties. shading, I'm going to do the properties. We can set the world color to white. And We can set the world color to white. And We can set the world color to white. And then to see that, you can either go to then to see that, you can either go to then to see that, you can either go to rendered mode. I'm going to go back to rendered mode. I'm going to go back to rendered mode. I'm going to go back to lookdev mode. You can enable scene lookdev mode. You can enable scene lookdev mode. You can enable scene world. The nice thing about this world. The nice thing about this world. The nice thing about this procedural approach is that it is that procedural approach is that it is that procedural approach is that it is that it is procedural. So, if I see that my it is procedural. So, if I see that my it is procedural. So, if I see that my O's are too big and I only give big O's. O's are too big and I only give big O's. O's are too big and I only give big O's. You can select all of those and then I'm You can select all of those and then I'm You can select all of those and then I'm going to go to edit mode. Although now going to go to edit mode. Although now going to go to edit mode. Although now we do want to scale to the world origin we do want to scale to the world origin we do want to scale to the world origin over here, don't we? So let's kind of over here, don't we? So let's kind of over here, don't we? So let's kind of scale to the 3D cursor. So that's going scale to the 3D cursor. So that's going scale to the 3D cursor. So that's going to make it like this. And let's see what to make it like this. And let's see what to make it like this. And let's see what that does. That not only shrinks the that does. That not only shrinks the that does. That not only shrinks the O's, but now you can see the spacing O's, but now you can see the spacing O's, but now you can see the spacing adjusts automatically. I'm seeing my E adjusts automatically. I'm seeing my E adjusts automatically. I'm seeing my E are still huge. And you know me, I are still huge. And you know me, I are still huge. And you know me, I always like my huge E. Uh, I'm going to always like my huge E. Uh, I'm going to always like my huge E. Uh, I'm going to scale that again to the world origin. scale that again to the world origin. scale that again to the world origin. And this is a good way. Is this really And this is a good way. Is this really And this is a good way. Is this really how you spell been? I've been I I how you spell been? I've been I I how you spell been? I've been I I remember I was once once I was taking a remember I was once once I was taking a remember I was once once I was taking a math test and I took like math in math test and I took like math in math test and I took like math in college, so you have to write proofs college, so you have to write proofs college, so you have to write proofs with English. And I could not remember with English. And I could not remember with English. And I could not remember how to spell of O F. I thought I just how to spell of O F. I thought I just how to spell of O F. I thought I just couldn't remember. So I'm like, is it couldn't remember. So I'm like, is it couldn't remember. So I'm like, is it UV? Is that how you spell bin? It just UV? Is that how you spell bin? It just UV? Is that how you spell bin? It just looks so weird to me. I know this is looks so weird to me. I know this is looks so weird to me. I know this is stupid, but I I'd feel stupider if I got stupid, but I I'd feel stupider if I got stupid, but I I'd feel stupider if I got it wrong. Bin definition. The social it wrong. Bin definition. The social it wrong. Bin definition. The social gathering where people Am I like having gathering where people Am I like having gathering where people Am I like having a stroke right now? How do you spell a stroke right now? How do you spell a stroke right now? How do you spell bin? I feel like I'm going nuts. Wait, bin? I feel like I'm going nuts. Wait, bin? I feel like I'm going nuts. Wait, how do you spell bin? What about like how do you spell bin? What about like how do you spell bin? What about like I've been thinking? That'll give me the I've been thinking? That'll give me the I've been thinking? That'll give me the right spelling. Yeah, that's how you right spelling. Yeah, that's how you right spelling. Yeah, that's how you spell it. I don't know. I don't know spell it. I don't know. I don't know spell it. I don't know. I don't know what's happening to me. Like I can do what's happening to me. Like I can do what's happening to me. Like I can do all this advanced geode stuff, but I all this advanced geode stuff, but I all this advanced geode stuff, but I can't spell bin. Seems about right. can't spell bin. Seems about right. can't spell bin. Seems about right. Okay, let's do another. And I'm actually Okay, let's do another. And I'm actually Okay, let's do another. And I'm actually going to write this one down here so going to write this one down here so going to write this one down here so that we can compare. You're not going to that we can compare. You're not going to that we can compare. You're not going to see it from here, but always brush your see it from here, but always brush your see it from here, but always brush your teeth, which is true. It's very teeth, which is true. It's very teeth, which is true. It's very important. First, before I reveal it, important. First, before I reveal it, important. First, before I reveal it, let's uh write this in here. Always let's uh write this in here. Always let's uh write this in here. Always brush your teeth. And just like magic, brush your teeth. And just like magic, brush your teeth. And just like magic, it's there. And we got to get rid of the it's there. And we got to get rid of the it's there. And we got to get rid of the corner alphabet. So, always brush your corner alphabet. So, always brush your corner alphabet. So, always brush your teeth. And let's compare it. So, get teeth. And let's compare it. So, get teeth. And let's compare it. So, get this in your head. Okay. Let's make that this in your head. Okay. Let's make that this in your head. Okay. Let's make that big. Always brush your teeth. Always big. Always brush your teeth. Always big. Always brush your teeth. Always brush your teeth. Yeah. Am I right? And if you wanted to Yeah. Am I right? And if you wanted to Yeah. Am I right? And if you wanted to change this so it's like lighter, change this so it's like lighter, change this so it's like lighter, darker, a different color, we use the darker, a different color, we use the darker, a different color, we use the shader editor. So let's kind of find one shader editor. So let's kind of find one shader editor. So let's kind of find one of our A's. I don't know which one it's of our A's. I don't know which one it's of our A's. I don't know which one it's going to be. Is it this one? It is this going to be. Is it this one? It is this going to be. Is it this one? It is this one. What I can do is I can mix. Maybe I one. What I can do is I can mix. Maybe I one. What I can do is I can mix. Maybe I can mix color. I'm going to have this as can mix color. I'm going to have this as can mix color. I'm going to have this as a factor and it can mix between pure the a factor and it can mix between pure the a factor and it can mix between pure the bottom should be pure white and then bottom should be pure white and then bottom should be pure white and then maybe the color red. So now I'm writing maybe the color red. So now I'm writing maybe the color red. So now I'm writing in red. As a final thing, cuz we've put in red. As a final thing, cuz we've put in red. As a final thing, cuz we've put in all this effort for it to be in all this effort for it to be in all this effort for it to be procedural. Let's add a bit more procedural. Let's add a bit more procedural. Let's add a bit more randomness. What do we think about that? randomness. What do we think about that? randomness. What do we think about that? Going to look at our positioner, which Going to look at our positioner, which Going to look at our positioner, which by the way, it's again just using a by the way, it's again just using a by the way, it's again just using a field to translate. So, I could always field to translate. So, I could always field to translate. So, I could always like I don't know, I can move it on the like I don't know, I can move it on the like I don't know, I can move it on the Y-axis or whatever. I like this cuz now Y-axis or whatever. I like this cuz now Y-axis or whatever. I like this cuz now the letters still won't cross each the letters still won't cross each the letters still won't cross each other. Whereas, if I did the X, these other. Whereas, if I did the X, these other. Whereas, if I did the X, these faces, these instances are now faces, these instances are now faces, these instances are now intersecting. I'm going to pick a random intersecting. I'm going to pick a random intersecting. I'm going to pick a random value maybe between minus1 and one. So, value maybe between minus1 and one. So, value maybe between minus1 and one. So, I can go up or down. Do this for the Y. I can go up or down. Do this for the Y. I can go up or down. Do this for the Y. Okay. And then we are going to multiply Okay. And then we are going to multiply Okay. And then we are going to multiply by a tiny number. So just like just like by a tiny number. So just like just like by a tiny number. So just like just like that. And that in itself can get a seed. that. And that in itself can get a seed. that. And that in itself can get a seed. I think that makes it look way more I think that makes it look way more I think that makes it look way more natural. So before after. So maybe this natural. So before after. So maybe this natural. So before after. So maybe this can also be a uh group input. So this can also be a uh group input. So this can also be a uh group input. So this can be our like Y variation or whatever. can be our like Y variation or whatever. can be our like Y variation or whatever. And look at that. And now you might And look at that. And now you might And look at that. And now you might think, oh, he's done. Like what a cool think, oh, he's done. Like what a cool think, oh, he's done. Like what a cool tutorial. I saved something for you. I tutorial. I saved something for you. I tutorial. I saved something for you. I saved a punch line. Right now all we're saved a punch line. Right now all we're saved a punch line. Right now all we're doing is we're typing in here. We have doing is we're typing in here. We have doing is we're typing in here. We have missing characters. We don't we can't missing characters. We don't we can't missing characters. We don't we can't type a number. What if I wanted to take type a number. What if I wanted to take type a number. What if I wanted to take a existing text file? Okay, can you see a existing text file? Okay, can you see a existing text file? Okay, can you see where I'm going with this? I don't want where I'm going with this? I don't want where I'm going with this? I don't want to write it. I just want to import it. to write it. I just want to import it. to write it. I just want to import it. Well, you may or may not know there's a Well, you may or may not know there's a Well, you may or may not know there's a import. Is there import text? There's a import. Is there import text? There's a import. Is there import text? There's a import text node. What does this do? It import text node. What does this do? It import text node. What does this do? It lets me pick a file, also a dynamic path lets me pick a file, also a dynamic path lets me pick a file, also a dynamic path if I wanted to. So, this is a way to if I wanted to. So, this is a way to if I wanted to. So, this is a way to type your homework and make it look like type your homework and make it look like type your homework and make it look like you wrote it like for real. Let's make a you wrote it like for real. Let's make a you wrote it like for real. Let's make a uh text file. So, I'm going to open up uh text file. So, I'm going to open up uh text file. So, I'm going to open up Notepad. I'm going to save this to be Notepad. I'm going to save this to be Notepad. I'm going to save this to be like our writing.ext. like our writing.ext. like our writing.ext. And I believe I don't think it updates And I believe I don't think it updates And I believe I don't think it updates unless we like refresh. I do know at unless we like refresh. I do know at unless we like refresh. I do know at least this one's wrong. Sally sells least this one's wrong. Sally sells least this one's wrong. Sally sells seashells. So let's kind of start with seashells. So let's kind of start with seashells. So let's kind of start with that. And I'm going to save it. And then that. And I'm going to save it. And then that. And I'm going to save it. And then for import text, I'm going to bring in for import text, I'm going to bring in for import text, I'm going to bring in this. And let's see. Connect that in this. And let's see. Connect that in this. And let's see. Connect that in here. So there we go. Sally sells here. So there we go. Sally sells here. So there we go. Sally sells seashells by. And I'm going to save seashells by. And I'm going to save seashells by. And I'm going to save that. And I think we have to reload it. that. And I think we have to reload it. that. And I think we have to reload it. Yeah. By the just like that. I wonder if Yeah. By the just like that. I wonder if Yeah. By the just like that. I wonder if a frame change counts as an update. So a frame change counts as an update. So a frame change counts as an update. So let's see. I'm going to write something let's see. I'm going to write something let's see. I'm going to write something and then I'm going to save. So let's do and then I'm going to save. So let's do and then I'm going to save. So let's do hello and then I'm going to save. No, I hello and then I'm going to save. No, I hello and then I'm going to save. No, I still have to reconnect that. I wonder still have to reconnect that. I wonder still have to reconnect that. I wonder if there's a trick. I wonder if there's if there's a trick. I wonder if there's if there's a trick. I wonder if there's a trick. Can I run simulation zone cuz I a trick. Can I run simulation zone cuz I a trick. Can I run simulation zone cuz I do think this is a cool idea. So, I'm do think this is a cool idea. So, I'm do think this is a cool idea. So, I'm going to run a simulation zone where the going to run a simulation zone where the going to run a simulation zone where the only thing it changes is the um string only thing it changes is the um string only thing it changes is the um string input. So, now I'm going to play this input. So, now I'm going to play this input. So, now I'm going to play this and it's going to bake like a simulation and it's going to bake like a simulation and it's going to bake like a simulation making sure the string is the same all making sure the string is the same all making sure the string is the same all the time. So, if I delete everything and the time. So, if I delete everything and the time. So, if I delete everything and I save. No. Could we put this inside the I save. No. Could we put this inside the I save. No. Could we put this inside the simulation zone? Does that force a simulation zone? Does that force a simulation zone? Does that force a reload? So, I'm going to say hello. I'm reload? So, I'm going to say hello. I'm reload? So, I'm going to say hello. I'm going to save this. So, let's do a going to save this. So, let's do a going to save this. So, let's do a refresh. And now I'm going to click refresh. And now I'm going to click refresh. And now I'm going to click play. So, it's dynamic. Test. And then a play. So, it's dynamic. Test. And then a play. So, it's dynamic. Test. And then a save. save. save. Got him. Save. There you go. So, that's Got him. Save. There you go. So, that's Got him. Save. There you go. So, that's how you force a reload. So, uh there you go. You could write a So, uh there you go. You could write a So, uh there you go. You could write a really long piece of text. You could really long piece of text. You could really long piece of text. You could even like import a book or something and even like import a book or something and even like import a book or something and make it look like you wrote it. The only make it look like you wrote it. The only make it look like you wrote it. The only missing component is we need it to have missing component is we need it to have missing component is we need it to have a sense of overflow. So, what that means a sense of overflow. So, what that means a sense of overflow. So, what that means is it, you know, goes to a different is it, you know, goes to a different is it, you know, goes to a different line or even better, it can look at the line or even better, it can look at the line or even better, it can look at the file and see if there's a line break. file and see if there's a line break. file and see if there's a line break. Yeah. Yeah. I do want to try that. I do Yeah. Yeah. I do want to try that. I do Yeah. Yeah. I do want to try that. I do want to try that. Become a member at want to try that.

Write me a Okay. There we go, boys. Write me a Okay. There we go, boys. Write me a 500word short story. Can't be line 500word short story. Can't be line 500word short story. Can't be line breaks. Yeah, this is going to be a breaks. Yeah, this is going to be a breaks. Yeah, this is going to be a beefy one cuz you could think of each beefy one cuz you could think of each beefy one cuz you could think of each letter as a iteration. Boom. There's my letter as a iteration. Boom. There's my letter as a iteration. Boom. There's my short story. Disconnect. Reconnect. It's short story. Disconnect. Reconnect. It's short story. Disconnect. Reconnect. It's chugging. I have faith though. Okay, I chugging. I have faith though. Okay, I chugging. I have faith though. Okay, I did it. This is weird to me cuz this is did it. This is weird to me cuz this is did it. This is weird to me cuz this is my handwriting. Like to me, like you my handwriting. Like to me, like you my handwriting. Like to me, like you might just think, "Oh, it's a thing." might just think, "Oh, it's a thing." might just think, "Oh, it's a thing." But to me, this is my handwriting.
