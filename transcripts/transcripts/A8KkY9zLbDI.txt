volumetrics are a great crutch for volumetrics are a great crutch for volumetrics are a great crutch for drowning your scene and enough fog to drowning your scene and enough fog to drowning your scene and enough fog to hide all the lack of detail because it hide all the lack of detail because it hide all the lack of detail because it can't be considered low effort if it's can't be considered low effort if it's can't be considered low effort if it's an abstract film like aesthetic mood an abstract film like aesthetic mood an abstract film like aesthetic mood piece thing even if your scene looks piece thing even if your scene looks piece thing even if your scene looks like garbage without it but hey that's like garbage without it but hey that's like garbage without it but hey that's not going to stop me from using it so not going to stop me from using it so not going to stop me from using it so I'm going to start off with a real quick I'm going to start off with a real quick I'm going to start off with a real quick rundown of all the volumetric settings rundown of all the volumetric settings rundown of all the volumetric settings the most important probably being Max the most important probably being Max the most important probably being Max bounces under light paths this will give bounces under light paths this will give bounces under light paths this will give you more detailed and realistic fog but you more detailed and realistic fog but you more detailed and realistic fog but it's at the cost of increasing your it's at the cost of increasing your it's at the cost of increasing your render Times by quite a bit step rate is render Times by quite a bit step rate is render Times by quite a bit step rate is effectively the resolution of the voils effectively the resolution of the voils effectively the resolution of the voils that make up the volume in this case a that make up the volume in this case a that make up the volume in this case a lower value will give a better result lower value will give a better result lower value will give a better result but you're probably not going to notice but you're probably not going to notice but you're probably not going to notice much of a difference unless you're using much of a difference unless you're using much of a difference unless you're using a texture with your a texture with your a texture with your volume in the material tab check the volume in the material tab check the volume in the material tab check the homogeneous button if you're not using homogeneous button if you're not using homogeneous button if you're not using textures theoretically this makes it textures theoretically this makes it textures theoretically this makes it render Faster by telling blender that render Faster by telling blender that render Faster by telling blender that your volume is all one same density but your volume is all one same density but your volume is all one same density but recent versions do this automatically so recent versions do this automatically so recent versions do this automatically so you can just click this button if you you can just click this button if you you can just click this button if you feel like it sampling is used for how feel like it sampling is used for how feel like it sampling is used for how you want to light your volume and you want to light your volume and you want to light your volume and interpolation is more used for smoke interpolation is more used for smoke interpolation is more used for smoke simulations unchecking some of the simulations unchecking some of the simulations unchecking some of the visibilities can improve render times visibilities can improve render times visibilities can improve render times especially with jadow but this may especially with jadow but this may especially with jadow but this may impact a lot of how your lighting impact a lot of how your lighting impact a lot of how your lighting interacts with the volume so there's interacts with the volume so there's interacts with the volume so there's four nodes you can plug into the four nodes you can plug into the four nodes you can plug into the material output principled volume volume material output principled volume volume material output principled volume volume absorption volume scatter and emission absorption volume scatter and emission absorption volume scatter and emission and as much as people use principled and as much as people use principled and as much as people use principled bsdf for everything I wouldn't really bsdf for everything I wouldn't really bsdf for everything I wouldn't really suggest using principled volume cuz it suggest using principled volume cuz it suggest using principled volume cuz it has a lot of settings that you won't has a lot of settings that you won't has a lot of settings that you won't really ever use and missing a lot of the really ever use and missing a lot of the really ever use and missing a lot of the settings that you should be using so settings that you should be using so settings that you should be using so volume absorption by itself is typically volume absorption by itself is typically volume absorption by itself is typically invisible until you start to add a color invisible until you start to add a color invisible until you start to add a color to it how it works is a little confusing to it how it works is a little confusing to it how it works is a little confusing because the naming is a bit backwards because the naming is a bit backwards because the naming is a bit backwards compared to how it actually functions compared to how it actually functions compared to how it actually functions what it does is absorb all light colors what it does is absorb all light colors what it does is absorb all light colors except to the color it's set to so if except to the color it's set to so if except to the color it's set to so if it's green it'll absorb red and blue it's green it'll absorb red and blue it's green it'll absorb red and blue light and only let green pass through light and only let green pass through light and only let green pass through and this is why when it's set to White and this is why when it's set to White and this is why when it's set to White all the lights allowed to pass through all the lights allowed to pass through all the lights allowed to pass through and when it's set to Black no light is and when it's set to Black no light is and when it's set to Black no light is so by itself this can be really useful so by itself this can be really useful so by itself this can be really useful for composition to remove certain colors for composition to remove certain colors for composition to remove certain colors of light from specific areas or to just of light from specific areas or to just of light from specific areas or to just block light entirely without anything block light entirely without anything block light entirely without anything visually in the way volume scattering is visually in the way volume scattering is visually in the way volume scattering is where we get the fog effect and if you where we get the fog effect and if you where we get the fog effect and if you change the color of it you might think change the color of it you might think change the color of it you might think that it's behaving weirdly but what's that it's behaving weirdly but what's that it's behaving weirdly but what's Happening Here is we're telling it to Happening Here is we're telling it to Happening Here is we're telling it to scatter only the red light and by doing scatter only the red light and by doing scatter only the red light and by doing that we're allowing green and blue to that we're allowing green and blue to that we're allowing green and blue to pass through unscattered creating C this pass through unscattered creating C this pass through unscattered creating C this combined with colored lights can allow combined with colored lights can allow combined with colored lights can allow certain lights to be scattered and other certain lights to be scattered and other certain lights to be scattered and other lights to be passed through but a much lights to be passed through but a much lights to be passed through but a much easier method is just to go to the easier method is just to go to the easier method is just to go to the lights Ray visibility settings and turn lights Ray visibility settings and turn lights Ray visibility settings and turn off volume scattering so overall off volume scattering so overall off volume scattering so overall changing the scattering color is a bit changing the scattering color is a bit changing the scattering color is a bit of a niche use case what you should of a niche use case what you should of a niche use case what you should tweak is the anistropy value how this tweak is the anistropy value how this tweak is the anistropy value how this works is it affects the direction light works is it affects the direction light works is it affects the direction light is scattered through the volume so a is scattered through the volume so a is scattered through the volume so a value of1 means all the light's going to value of1 means all the light's going to value of1 means all the light's going to be reflected backwards value of zero be reflected backwards value of zero be reflected backwards value of zero means it's going to be scattered in all means it's going to be scattered in all means it's going to be scattered in all directions equally and a value of one directions equally and a value of one directions equally and a value of one means it's going to be reflected means it's going to be reflected means it's going to be reflected forwards and with a simple setup like forwards and with a simple setup like forwards and with a simple setup like this you can take advantage of using this you can take advantage of using this you can take advantage of using both directions at the same both directions at the same both directions at the same time the volume scattering node also has time the volume scattering node also has time the volume scattering node also has five different options for how it'll five different options for how it'll five different options for how it'll scatter the light each one was built scatter the light each one was built scatter the light each one was built with a specific use case in mind and with a specific use case in mind and with a specific use case in mind and they all have their own settings but for they all have their own settings but for they all have their own settings but for the most part you can just use whichever the most part you can just use whichever the most part you can just use whichever one looks the best in your scene because one looks the best in your scene because one looks the best in your scene because none of them should really render faster none of them should really render faster none of them should really render faster than the others it is worth looking than the others it is worth looking than the others it is worth looking through all of them though and tweaking through all of them though and tweaking through all of them though and tweaking with the settings depending on your with the settings depending on your with the settings depending on your lighting and size of the lighting and size of the lighting and size of the [Music] [Music] [Music] volume emissions pretty straightforward volume emissions pretty straightforward volume emissions pretty straightforward it'll make your volume glow just like it'll make your volume glow just like it'll make your volume glow just like how it would on a Surface so then by how it would on a Surface so then by how it would on a Surface so then by plugging in some textures you can make plugging in some textures you can make plugging in some textures you can make some procedural 3D glowing effects some procedural 3D glowing effects some procedural 3D glowing effects [Music] [Music] [Music] since volumes have their own output you since volumes have their own output you since volumes have their own output you can mix them with any translucent or can mix them with any translucent or can mix them with any translucent or transparent Shader you plug into the transparent Shader you plug into the transparent Shader you plug into the surface output pairing this with a glass surface output pairing this with a glass surface output pairing this with a glass Shader is a really easy way to make Shader is a really easy way to make Shader is a really easy way to make fogged glass or murky fogged glass or murky fogged glass or murky water and of course all the normal water and of course all the normal water and of course all the normal settings still apply so you can make settings still apply so you can make settings still apply so you can make some neat effects with some neat effects with some neat effects with [Music] [Music] [Music] this now the biggest downside of using this now the biggest downside of using this now the biggest downside of using volume metrics is they can be really volume metrics is they can be really volume metrics is they can be really expensive to render but here's a method expensive to render but here's a method expensive to render but here's a method that can make them almost instantaneous that can make them almost instantaneous that can make them almost instantaneous the first thing you need to do is the first thing you need to do is the first thing you need to do is disable most of the rid visibilities disable most of the rid visibilities disable most of the rid visibilities especially especially especially Shadows depending on your scene it might Shadows depending on your scene it might Shadows depending on your scene it might change your lighting a bit so you can go change your lighting a bit so you can go change your lighting a bit so you can go back and tweak back and tweak back and tweak that next we're going to move the volume that next we're going to move the volume that next we're going to move the volume object into its own collection and to object into its own collection and to object into its own collection and to make things easier I'm going to move make things easier I'm going to move make things easier I'm going to move everything else into another everything else into another everything else into another collection then go into the filters of collection then go into the filters of collection then go into the filters of the outliner and make sure you have hold the outliner and make sure you have hold the outliner and make sure you have hold out and indirect lighting out and indirect lighting out and indirect lighting enabled from here disable the volume enabled from here disable the volume enabled from here disable the volume collection you just made using this collection you just made using this collection you just made using this checkbox and we're going to going to checkbox and we're going to going to checkbox and we're going to going to make a new view layer with copied make a new view layer with copied make a new view layer with copied settings now while we're on this new settings now while we're on this new settings now while we're on this new view layer reenable the volume view layer reenable the volume view layer reenable the volume collection and then turn on hold out and collection and then turn on hold out and collection and then turn on hold out and indirect for everything else your scene indirect for everything else your scene indirect for everything else your scene should look something like this or this should look something like this or this should look something like this or this depending on what your volumetric setup depending on what your volumetric setup depending on what your volumetric setup is then the most important step is to go is then the most important step is to go is then the most important step is to go to the override section and the view to the override section and the view to the override section and the view layer Tab and set the sample size to layer Tab and set the sample size to layer Tab and set the sample size to something very low if we render out the something very low if we render out the something very low if we render out the image it might look like there's no image it might look like there's no image it might look like there's no volume metrics but what we need to do is volume metrics but what we need to do is volume metrics but what we need to do is go to the compositor and duplicate this go to the compositor and duplicate this go to the compositor and duplicate this rendered layer input then we're going to rendered layer input then we're going to rendered layer input then we're going to switch it over to the volume layer and switch it over to the volume layer and switch it over to the volume layer and we should have two images one without we should have two images one without we should have two images one without volumetric and one that's only volumetric and one that's only volumetric and one that's only volumetrics all we have to do is add the volumetrics all we have to do is add the volumetrics all we have to do is add the two layers together and it should look two layers together and it should look two layers together and it should look almost identical to the original image almost identical to the original image almost identical to the original image but of course you can mix these two but of course you can mix these two but of course you can mix these two layers in any way that looks the best layers in any way that looks the best layers in any way that looks the best once again everything in this video is once again everything in this video is once again everything in this video is going to be available for download in going to be available for download in going to be available for download in the description so check that out if the description so check that out if the description so check that out if you're interested you're interested
