The Great Flood had some really cool The Great Flood had some really cool The Great Flood had some really cool visual effects and at the same time just visual effects and at the same time just visual effects and at the same time just horrible, horrible. I don't even know horrible, horrible. I don't even know horrible, horrible. I don't even know what happened here. Regardless, my what happened here. Regardless, my what happened here. Regardless, my favorite effect is this one. It's a kind favorite effect is this one. It's a kind favorite effect is this one. It's a kind of set extension, but a void. I made my of set extension, but a void. I made my of set extension, but a void. I made my own version and to be honest, I like own version and to be honest, I like own version and to be honest, I like mine a lot better. I start off with a mine a lot better. I start off with a mine a lot better. I start off with a shot that I then track. I then modeled shot that I then track. I then modeled shot that I then track. I then modeled the very, very basic geometry of the very, very basic geometry of the very, very basic geometry of essentially what I want to remove. Then essentially what I want to remove. Then essentially what I want to remove. Then for those areas, I need particles. And I for those areas, I need particles. And I for those areas, I need particles. And I figure I should probably play both of figure I should probably play both of figure I should probably play both of these shots that I made to completion. these shots that I made to completion. these shots that I made to completion. So, wow, look at this. Such good visual So, wow, look at this. Such good visual So, wow, look at this. Such good visual effects. I know they probably have like effects. I know they probably have like effects. I know they probably have like a limited time budget, but I don't. So, a limited time budget, but I don't. So, a limited time budget, but I don't. So, I get to gloat. This video is sponsored I get to gloat. This video is sponsored I get to gloat. This video is sponsored by Squarespace, and we're going to talk by Squarespace, and we're going to talk by Squarespace, and we're going to talk about that later. Imagine a cube that, about that later. Imagine a cube that, about that later. Imagine a cube that, let's say, is black and we spawn a whole let's say, is black and we spawn a whole let's say, is black and we spawn a whole bunch of particles on it. For each bunch of particles on it. For each bunch of particles on it. For each particle, I'm just going to find the particle, I'm just going to find the particle, I'm just going to find the nearest edge and then push it towards nearest edge and then push it towards nearest edge and then push it towards that so it's concentrated on the edges. that so it's concentrated on the edges. that so it's concentrated on the edges. Add some like variation and radius and a Add some like variation and radius and a Add some like variation and radius and a bit of noise. And that is the effect. bit of noise. And that is the effect. bit of noise. And that is the effect. For motion tracking, I'm going to use my For motion tracking, I'm going to use my For motion tracking, I'm going to use my camera tracker add-on. Select the video camera tracker add-on. Select the video camera tracker add-on. Select the video to turn it into a image sequence. In to turn it into a image sequence. In to turn it into a image sequence. In this case, I have a video and it is now this case, I have a video and it is now this case, I have a video and it is now images. Great. do an accelerated track images. Great. do an accelerated track images. Great. do an accelerated track that uses the GPU and just hope that it that uses the GPU and just hope that it that uses the GPU and just hope that it works. Even though I'm supposed to mask works. Even though I'm supposed to mask works. Even though I'm supposed to mask the actor, you can track yourself, but the actor, you can track yourself, but the actor, you can track yourself, but something something promo something something something promo something something something promo something money. And here we go. Okay, good money. And here we go. Okay, good money. And here we go. Okay, good enough. So, we have our camera. We have enough. So, we have our camera. We have enough. So, we have our camera. We have a point cloud. It's not the densest a point cloud. It's not the densest a point cloud. It's not the densest thing in the world. And I'm just going thing in the world. And I'm just going thing in the world. And I'm just going to roughly orient it to the uh world to roughly orient it to the uh world to roughly orient it to the uh world coordinates. Now, if I go into the coordinates. Now, if I go into the coordinates. Now, if I go into the camera, you can kind of see the camera camera, you can kind of see the camera camera, you can kind of see the camera motion. We're going to select our camera motion. We're going to select our camera motion. We're going to select our camera so that I can actually see the so that I can actually see the so that I can actually see the background. That's going to be a movie background. That's going to be a movie background. That's going to be a movie clip. Indeed, we have a track. This clip. Indeed, we have a track. This clip. Indeed, we have a track. This point cloud for the most part is pretty point cloud for the most part is pretty point cloud for the most part is pretty useless except for kind of the areas useless except for kind of the areas useless except for kind of the areas where it outlines the uh car. I do have where it outlines the uh car. I do have where it outlines the uh car. I do have an operator for this called the clean an operator for this called the clean an operator for this called the clean operator which will get rid of most of operator which will get rid of most of operator which will get rid of most of the junk but still not too useful. I now the junk but still not too useful. I now the junk but still not too useful. I now want to model the scene which involves want to model the scene which involves want to model the scene which involves you know modeling. So let's kind of take you know modeling. So let's kind of take you know modeling. So let's kind of take our coordinate system and I want this our coordinate system and I want this our coordinate system and I want this like XY to be put somewhere useful maybe like XY to be put somewhere useful maybe like XY to be put somewhere useful maybe at the corner of this column. So this at the corner of this column. So this at the corner of this column. So this like world parent that moves everything like world parent that moves everything like world parent that moves everything I'm going to set this to move relative I'm going to set this to move relative I'm going to set this to move relative to the 3D cursor. So the world origin in to the 3D cursor. So the world origin in to the 3D cursor. So the world origin in this case, shift it on the X, shift it this case, shift it on the X, shift it this case, shift it on the X, shift it on the Y until we're roughly in the on the Y until we're roughly in the on the Y until we're roughly in the corner over here. Let's play a bit corner over here. Let's play a bit corner over here. Let's play a bit forwards. Yeah, that looks pretty good. forwards. Yeah, that looks pretty good. forwards. Yeah, that looks pretty good. And then finally, we need the scene And then finally, we need the scene And then finally, we need the scene scale. If I add a plane, by default, if scale. If I add a plane, by default, if scale. If I add a plane, by default, if you look at the dimensions, it's going you look at the dimensions, it's going you look at the dimensions, it's going to be 2x 2 m, which unless I'm a huge to be 2x 2 m, which unless I'm a huge to be 2x 2 m, which unless I'm a huge man, which maybe I am. This seems pretty man, which maybe I am. This seems pretty man, which maybe I am. This seems pretty small for 2 m. So take this again with small for 2 m. So take this again with small for 2 m. So take this again with the world origin scaling, and I'm just the world origin scaling, and I'm just the world origin scaling, and I'm just going to scale it, which effectively going to scale it, which effectively going to scale it, which effectively moves the camera and everything closer moves the camera and everything closer moves the camera and everything closer to the center until it looks roughly 2 to the center until it looks roughly 2 to the center until it looks roughly 2 m. Now, I find the easiest way to model m. Now, I find the easiest way to model m. Now, I find the easiest way to model things is with wireframe mode enabled, things is with wireframe mode enabled, things is with wireframe mode enabled, so we can kind of see through. Minus one so we can kind of see through. Minus one so we can kind of see through. Minus one on the Y, one on the X, so that the on the Y, one on the X, so that the on the Y, one on the X, so that the corner is exactly where it needs to be. corner is exactly where it needs to be. corner is exactly where it needs to be. And now do the worst modeling job in the And now do the worst modeling job in the And now do the worst modeling job in the history of modeling jobs. I'll do a history of modeling jobs. I'll do a history of modeling jobs. I'll do a little bit of it here. Really, all I'm little bit of it here. Really, all I'm little bit of it here. Really, all I'm doing is I'm outlining only the parts of doing is I'm outlining only the parts of doing is I'm outlining only the parts of the scene that we would indeed see. So, the scene that we would indeed see. So, the scene that we would indeed see. So, you can go to the last frame and be you can go to the last frame and be you can go to the last frame and be like, ah, you don't need to go much like, ah, you don't need to go much like, ah, you don't need to go much further than this on the X. And ideally, further than this on the X. And ideally, further than this on the X. And ideally, we model everything, but like who cares? we model everything, but like who cares? we model everything, but like who cares? Okay, now that you have your we'll call Okay, now that you have your we'll call Okay, now that you have your we'll call it our good enough scene where we have it our good enough scene where we have it our good enough scene where we have like the rough geometry since we're like the rough geometry since we're like the rough geometry since we're doing that idea where the points move to doing that idea where the points move to doing that idea where the points move to the edges. We don't want extra geometry. the edges. We don't want extra geometry. the edges. We don't want extra geometry. In other words, extra edges it can go In other words, extra edges it can go In other words, extra edges it can go to. If I look at edit mode, you can see to. If I look at edit mode, you can see to. If I look at edit mode, you can see a single surface that just represents a a single surface that just represents a a single surface that just represents a section of the floor has a lot of extra section of the floor has a lot of extra section of the floor has a lot of extra geometry. We can get rid of that just by geometry. We can get rid of that just by geometry. We can get rid of that just by hitting X, going to limited dissolve, hitting X, going to limited dissolve, hitting X, going to limited dissolve, and all of the sudden it is a single and all of the sudden it is a single and all of the sudden it is a single engon. Instead of doing this like one engon. Instead of doing this like one engon. Instead of doing this like one patch by another. So this is a limited patch by another. So this is a limited patch by another. So this is a limited dissolve. This is a limited dissolve. dissolve. This is a limited dissolve. dissolve. This is a limited dissolve. What you can do is A to select What you can do is A to select What you can do is A to select everything and then run a limited everything and then run a limited everything and then run a limited dissolve. And now we can just do our dissolve. And now we can just do our dissolve. And now we can just do our geometry nodes, right? I guess we should geometry nodes, right? I guess we should geometry nodes, right? I guess we should apply scale is a good idea. So control apply scale is a good idea. So control apply scale is a good idea. So control A, apply scale. And then I'm going to A, apply scale. And then I'm going to A, apply scale. And then I'm going to distribute points on the surface on distribute points on the surface on distribute points on the surface on faces. And all of a sudden, yikes, we faces. And all of a sudden, yikes, we faces. And all of a sudden, yikes, we got so many points. In fact, we want got so many points. In fact, we want got so many points. In fact, we want many more. So I'm going to make 200 of many more. So I'm going to make 200 of many more. So I'm going to make 200 of these until this coats it quite nicely. these until this coats it quite nicely. these until this coats it quite nicely. Let's maybe take our point radius and Let's maybe take our point radius and Let's maybe take our point radius and make it really, really tiny. So divide make it really, really tiny. So divide make it really, really tiny. So divide by five. Bump this up even more. And now by five. Bump this up even more. And now by five. Bump this up even more. And now we have our surface coded in points. To we have our surface coded in points. To we have our surface coded in points. To see this in reference to the original see this in reference to the original see this in reference to the original geometry, all I need to do is I join geometry, all I need to do is I join geometry, all I need to do is I join these together. And now I have my these together. And now I have my these together. And now I have my original surface with its points. original surface with its points. original surface with its points. Remember for every single point, so Remember for every single point, so Remember for every single point, so let's say this one over here. It should let's say this one over here. It should let's say this one over here. It should identify its nearest edge on the surface identify its nearest edge on the surface identify its nearest edge on the surface geometry. So in this case, obviously geometry. So in this case, obviously geometry. So in this case, obviously it's going to be this one. And then it it's going to be this one. And then it it's going to be this one. And then it should, you know, gradually move in that should, you know, gradually move in that should, you know, gradually move in that direction. And that should especially direction. And that should especially direction. And that should especially apply to points that are much further apply to points that are much further apply to points that are much further away. So let's say this one over here. away. So let's say this one over here. away. So let's say this one over here. It also has this as its nearest edge, It also has this as its nearest edge, It also has this as its nearest edge, but it should move a lot more than the but it should move a lot more than the but it should move a lot more than the one that's close to it. Well, geometry one that's close to it. Well, geometry one that's close to it. Well, geometry proximity is the easiest way to do this proximity is the easiest way to do this proximity is the easiest way to do this cuz I can find the nearest edge of what cuz I can find the nearest edge of what cuz I can find the nearest edge of what the original surface that I'm inputting. the original surface that I'm inputting. the original surface that I'm inputting. And that will not only find the nearest And that will not only find the nearest And that will not only find the nearest edge, but the position on that edge. Is edge, but the position on that edge. Is edge, but the position on that edge. Is it at the top, the bottom? Somewhere in it at the top, the bottom? Somewhere in it at the top, the bottom? Somewhere in the middle? Now, if I was to set the middle? Now, if I was to set the middle? Now, if I was to set position, in other words, you know, move position, in other words, you know, move position, in other words, you know, move the point cloud. If I was to use this as the point cloud. If I was to use this as the point cloud. If I was to use this as the actual position, you can see it maps the actual position, you can see it maps the actual position, you can see it maps to the nearest edge. I don't want that. to the nearest edge. I don't want that. to the nearest edge. I don't want that. I want it to go some of the way. So, we I want it to go some of the way. So, we I want it to go some of the way. So, we can take the position and I can mix a can take the position and I can mix a can take the position and I can mix a vector with, let's say, the original vector with, let's say, the original vector with, let's say, the original position before we even moved it. Here's position before we even moved it. Here's position before we even moved it. Here's before and after. And then how much that before and after. And then how much that before and after. And then how much that moves by. I mean, I guess it should be moves by. I mean, I guess it should be moves by. I mean, I guess it should be randomized, but it should also be based randomized, but it should also be based randomized, but it should also be based on the distance. Luckily, we also have on the distance. Luckily, we also have on the distance. Luckily, we also have this distance that tells us, okay, we go this distance that tells us, okay, we go this distance that tells us, okay, we go to the nearest edge. How far away is to the nearest edge. How far away is to the nearest edge. How far away is that? And that could somehow be related that? And that could somehow be related that? And that could somehow be related to our factor. Let's throw this through to our factor. Let's throw this through to our factor. Let's throw this through a map range. And then, what do I want to a map range. And then, what do I want to a map range. And then, what do I want to say? Well, I definitely want this to say? Well, I definitely want this to say? Well, I definitely want this to affect the factor. And I also don't want affect the factor. And I also don't want affect the factor. And I also don't want it to be so like harsh as it is right it to be so like harsh as it is right it to be so like harsh as it is right now. Let's use a smoother step. I want now. Let's use a smoother step. I want now. Let's use a smoother step. I want to make sure it gets close enough to the to make sure it gets close enough to the to make sure it gets close enough to the edge so we can see what's going on. So edge so we can see what's going on. So edge so we can see what's going on. So something like 6. And then let's add a something like 6. And then let's add a something like 6. And then let's add a bit of a randomization random value. As bit of a randomization random value. As bit of a randomization random value. As I increase this, it moves more towards I increase this, it moves more towards I increase this, it moves more towards the edge. So let's do 0 to one to start. the edge. So let's do 0 to one to start. the edge. So let's do 0 to one to start. And maybe since we like 0.5, let's hover And maybe since we like 0.5, let's hover And maybe since we like 0.5, let's hover around there. So like 3 to 7 before around there. So like 3 to 7 before around there. So like 3 to 7 before after it just kind of breaks it up a after it just kind of breaks it up a after it just kind of breaks it up a little. Another thing is this from little. Another thing is this from little. Another thing is this from maximum that you can see kind of affects maximum that you can see kind of affects maximum that you can see kind of affects the range of it. Maybe that in itself the range of it. Maybe that in itself the range of it. Maybe that in itself can be randomized. And maybe instead of can be randomized. And maybe instead of can be randomized. And maybe instead of a random value, I have that be more of a a random value, I have that be more of a a random value, I have that be more of a continuous noise. I'm going to take this continuous noise. I'm going to take this continuous noise. I'm going to take this noise texture. I'm going to throw it noise texture. I'm going to throw it noise texture. I'm going to throw it through a map range on its own. And through a map range on its own. And through a map range on its own. And noise texture, especially when we have noise texture, especially when we have noise texture, especially when we have normalize enabled, tends to hover around normalize enabled, tends to hover around normalize enabled, tends to hover around 0.5. It's a random number between 0 and 0.5. It's a random number between 0 and 0.5. It's a random number between 0 and one. On average, it's somewhere in the one. On average, it's somewhere in the one. On average, it's somewhere in the middle. Let's go from 04 to 6. And then middle. Let's go from 04 to 6. And then middle. Let's go from 04 to 6. And then instead of one, let's go 1 to three. instead of one, let's go 1 to three. instead of one, let's go 1 to three. That's pretty good. So you can almost That's pretty good. So you can almost That's pretty good. So you can almost see these like waves where the noise is see these like waves where the noise is see these like waves where the noise is affecting it. And then what do I want affecting it. And then what do I want affecting it. And then what do I want for the noise? Should it be high for the noise? Should it be high for the noise? Should it be high frequency? Should it be low frequency? frequency? Should it be low frequency? frequency? Should it be low frequency? Maybe low frequency with some detail and Maybe low frequency with some detail and Maybe low frequency with some detail and some roughness. And maybe it can go a some roughness. And maybe it can go a some roughness. And maybe it can go a bit closer. So like 6 to 1 and a half. bit closer. So like 6 to 1 and a half. bit closer. So like 6 to 1 and a half. But I think this is way better than the But I think this is way better than the But I think this is way better than the initial distance was. All of this set initial distance was. All of this set initial distance was. All of this set position nonsense can be a node group. position nonsense can be a node group. position nonsense can be a node group. Ctrl G. Move to edges. And then maybe a Ctrl G. Move to edges. And then maybe a Ctrl G. Move to edges. And then maybe a second thing we can do is we can add second thing we can do is we can add second thing we can do is we can add some additional points that aren't some additional points that aren't some additional points that aren't affected by this like edge gravity. just affected by this like edge gravity. just affected by this like edge gravity. just smaller points that fill in the space. smaller points that fill in the space. smaller points that fill in the space. Let's distribute points on faces again Let's distribute points on faces again Let's distribute points on faces again with a different seed. This one should with a different seed. This one should with a different seed. This one should have way more, maybe like 3,000. I join have way more, maybe like 3,000. I join have way more, maybe like 3,000. I join this together, which makes it totally this together, which makes it totally this together, which makes it totally covered, but maybe these points that covered, but maybe these points that covered, but maybe these points that aren't going towards the edge have a aren't going towards the edge have a aren't going towards the edge have a much smaller radius. Let's randomize the much smaller radius. Let's randomize the much smaller radius. Let's randomize the radius and call it a day. Right? So, radius and call it a day. Right? So, radius and call it a day. Right? So, instead of the radius being 0.01, I'm instead of the radius being 0.01, I'm instead of the radius being 0.01, I'm going to keep it as simple as a random going to keep it as simple as a random going to keep it as simple as a random value. Yikes, that's big. Multiply this value. Yikes, that's big. Multiply this value. Yikes, that's big. Multiply this by 0.01. So, it goes from a maximum of by 0.01. So, it goes from a maximum of by 0.01. So, it goes from a maximum of 0.01 and a minimum of zero. And then one 0.01 and a minimum of zero. And then one 0.01 and a minimum of zero. And then one thing I like to do is right now this thing I like to do is right now this thing I like to do is right now this random value if I look between a sample random value if I look between a sample random value if I look between a sample of like zero and one you know some of like zero and one you know some of like zero and one you know some points are going to be here around zero points are going to be here around zero points are going to be here around zero some of them are going to be around one some of them are going to be around one some of them are going to be around one but generally it's going to be equally but generally it's going to be equally but generally it's going to be equally distributed right there's going to be as distributed right there's going to be as distributed right there's going to be as many points down here as there are up many points down here as there are up many points down here as there are up here. What I think I prefer is I want here. What I think I prefer is I want here. What I think I prefer is I want most of them to be small and then a few most of them to be small and then a few most of them to be small and then a few outliers. So we can bias this instead of outliers. So we can bias this instead of outliers. So we can bias this instead of a 0ero to one randomization. I'm going a 0ero to one randomization. I'm going a 0ero to one randomization. I'm going to throw it through a float curve. So to throw it through a float curve. So to throw it through a float curve. So right now this is uniform and then maybe right now this is uniform and then maybe right now this is uniform and then maybe what I can do is I can heavily bias what I can do is I can heavily bias what I can do is I can heavily bias this. So most of them are quite tiny. I this. So most of them are quite tiny. I this. So most of them are quite tiny. I kind of like this linear cuz it's easier kind of like this linear cuz it's easier kind of like this linear cuz it's easier to control. And with isolating these, to control. And with isolating these, to control. And with isolating these, let's see that before and after. Kind of let's see that before and after. Kind of let's see that before and after. Kind of intense, right? So let me make it not as intense, right? So let me make it not as intense, right? So let me make it not as insane. So these points are randomized, insane. So these points are randomized, insane. So these points are randomized, but a few of them are going to be much but a few of them are going to be much but a few of them are going to be much bigger. And I want to take this same bigger. And I want to take this same bigger. And I want to take this same idea and maybe put it up here with these idea and maybe put it up here with these idea and maybe put it up here with these smaller points that we're distributing. smaller points that we're distributing. smaller points that we're distributing. Join these in. These have a much tinier Join these in. These have a much tinier Join these in. These have a much tinier average radius of 0.002. Let me just average radius of 0.002. Let me just average radius of 0.002. Let me just kind of take a third of this, let's say. kind of take a third of this, let's say. kind of take a third of this, let's say. And now if I isolate these, there's a And now if I isolate these, there's a And now if I isolate these, there's a bunch of tiny ones, but some of them are bunch of tiny ones, but some of them are bunch of tiny ones, but some of them are a bit bigger. Well, maybe since we're a bit bigger. Well, maybe since we're a bit bigger. Well, maybe since we're using this randomization twice. Let's using this randomization twice. Let's using this randomization twice. Let's turn this into a node group where we turn this into a node group where we turn this into a node group where we affect kind of this average size affect kind of this average size affect kind of this average size multiplier. So, this is going to be 0.01 multiplier. So, this is going to be 0.01 multiplier. So, this is going to be 0.01 and then we have the same thing up here, and then we have the same thing up here, and then we have the same thing up here, but it's like 0.003. Call this our but it's like 0.003. Call this our but it's like 0.003. Call this our random size. And maybe we should break random size. And maybe we should break random size. And maybe we should break apart this joint geometry. So, we have apart this joint geometry. So, we have apart this joint geometry. So, we have our points and then we have our surface. our points and then we have our surface. our points and then we have our surface. So, we have some points here. We have So, we have some points here. We have So, we have some points here. We have the ones we move to the edges. And then the ones we move to the edges. And then the ones we move to the edges. And then we have this extra stuff. Let's get rid we have this extra stuff. Let's get rid we have this extra stuff. Let's get rid of the extra stuff and then kind of put of the extra stuff and then kind of put of the extra stuff and then kind of put it at the end here with its own join it at the end here with its own join it at the end here with its own join geometry.

Just head over to Squarespace, make your Just head over to Squarespace, make your Just head over to Squarespace, make your own website, and when you're ready to own website, and when you're ready to own website, and when you're ready to take that and launch, you can use my take that and launch, you can use my take that and launch, you can use my link down below in the description to link down below in the description to link down below in the description to save 10% off your first purchase of a save 10% off your first purchase of a save 10% off your first purchase of a website or a domain. We have our website or a domain. We have our website or a domain. We have our surface, which we distributed points on, surface, which we distributed points on, surface, which we distributed points on, made them a certain size. We did that made them a certain size. We did that made them a certain size. We did that again for this other point distribution again for this other point distribution again for this other point distribution that we moved towards the edges. I that we moved towards the edges. I that we moved towards the edges. I joined these contributions together. We joined these contributions together. We joined these contributions together. We then have our original surface and I put then have our original surface and I put then have our original surface and I put it all together. The nice thing about it all together. The nice thing about it all together. The nice thing about this is now that we've separated these this is now that we've separated these this is now that we've separated these joinings, I can apply a material to each joinings, I can apply a material to each joinings, I can apply a material to each of them. So, this gets a material. This of them. So, this gets a material. This of them. So, this gets a material. This gets a material. What are those gets a material. What are those gets a material. What are those materials called? Well, one can be materials called? Well, one can be materials called? Well, one can be called the void and then one of them is called the void and then one of them is called the void and then one of them is going to be called the points. The going to be called the points. The going to be called the points. The points gets the points and then the points gets the points and then the points gets the points and then the surface gets the void. Our points are surface gets the void. Our points are surface gets the void. Our points are going to be a simple emission shader going to be a simple emission shader going to be a simple emission shader that are going to kind of be this that are going to kind of be this that are going to kind of be this orangey viery color. And then our void orangey viery color. And then our void orangey viery color. And then our void can be pretty black. This is more like I can be pretty black. This is more like I can be pretty black. This is more like I made a powdered donut or something like made a powdered donut or something like made a powdered donut or something like that. Um, how do I want to remedy this? that. Um, how do I want to remedy this? that. Um, how do I want to remedy this? One thing we can do pretty easily is One thing we can do pretty easily is One thing we can do pretty easily is take the emission and bring it down. But take the emission and bring it down. But take the emission and bring it down. But that's still a bit I think there's just that's still a bit I think there's just that's still a bit I think there's just too many points is what's is what's too many points is what's is what's too many points is what's is what's going on here. Let's make it half as going on here. Let's make it half as going on here. Let's make it half as much. And then our ones on the edges, much. And then our ones on the edges, much. And then our ones on the edges, but they're a bit too big. So, let's but they're a bit too big. So, let's but they're a bit too big. So, let's make it 0.007. make it 0.007. make it 0.007. Bring down the number of points a Bring down the number of points a Bring down the number of points a little. And then one more thing we can little. And then one more thing we can little. And then one more thing we can do is our points that are everywhere. I do is our points that are everywhere. I do is our points that are everywhere. I like the size, but they're kind of like like the size, but they're kind of like like the size, but they're kind of like too perfectly distributed. So, I think too perfectly distributed. So, I think too perfectly distributed. So, I think finally for the radius of at least this finally for the radius of at least this finally for the radius of at least this one, I can throw it through one final one, I can throw it through one final one, I can throw it through one final multiplication, which is one final scale multiplication, which is one final scale multiplication, which is one final scale factor. And then that multiplication can factor. And then that multiplication can factor. And then that multiplication can be by some like noise texture, something be by some like noise texture, something be by some like noise texture, something pretty continuous. Noise texture goes in pretty continuous. Noise texture goes in pretty continuous. Noise texture goes in here. I wanted a bit higher contrast. So here. I wanted a bit higher contrast. So here. I wanted a bit higher contrast. So remember noise texture averages around remember noise texture averages around remember noise texture averages around 0.5. I'm going to go 04 to 6. So now you 0.5. I'm going to go 04 to 6. So now you 0.5. I'm going to go 04 to 6. So now you can see these nice patches that are you can see these nice patches that are you can see these nice patches that are you can kind of see the pattern too much. So can kind of see the pattern too much. So can kind of see the pattern too much. So I'm going to bring down the scale. Add I'm going to bring down the scale. Add I'm going to bring down the scale. Add detail. Add roughness. This is the detail. Add roughness. This is the detail. Add roughness. This is the before and the after. Just adds that before and the after. Just adds that before and the after. Just adds that nice texture. As for the emission nice texture. As for the emission nice texture. As for the emission shader, I think one cool thing we can do shader, I think one cool thing we can do shader, I think one cool thing we can do is they're orange, but maybe some of is they're orange, but maybe some of is they're orange, but maybe some of them are like yellow or a different them are like yellow or a different them are like yellow or a different color. Because these are points, we can color. Because these are points, we can color. Because these are points, we can actually use the point info node that actually use the point info node that actually use the point info node that tells us the position of the points, the tells us the position of the points, the tells us the position of the points, the radius, which is really tiny, and most radius, which is really tiny, and most radius, which is really tiny, and most importantly, this random, which is going importantly, this random, which is going importantly, this random, which is going to be some number between 0 and one for to be some number between 0 and one for to be some number between 0 and one for each of these. We could use this for the each of these. We could use this for the each of these. We could use this for the strength of the emission, but also I can strength of the emission, but also I can strength of the emission, but also I can take this random. I can check where is take this random. I can check where is take this random. I can check where is it greater than some threshold. So it greater than some threshold. So it greater than some threshold. So something like.99. So only 1% of it is something like.99. So only 1% of it is something like.99. So only 1% of it is going to get a different color. And I going to get a different color. And I going to get a different color. And I can mix between two color options. This can mix between two color options. This can mix between two color options. This should be a mix color. We have our should be a mix color. We have our should be a mix color. We have our orange and then the 1% chance can go to orange and then the 1% chance can go to orange and then the 1% chance can go to this like yellow which connects here. this like yellow which connects here. this like yellow which connects here. And you totally can't see the difference And you totally can't see the difference And you totally can't see the difference at all. Maybe there just aren't enough. at all. Maybe there just aren't enough. at all. Maybe there just aren't enough. So let's do 95 instead. Yeah, now I can So let's do 95 instead. Yeah, now I can So let's do 95 instead. Yeah, now I can see them a bit better. Maybe they should see them a bit better. Maybe they should see them a bit better. Maybe they should be a bit more orange or red or be a bit more orange or red or be a bit more orange or red or something. I think one of the last something. I think one of the last something. I think one of the last things we need to do is obviously this things we need to do is obviously this things we need to do is obviously this looks fine, but it doesn't make sense in looks fine, but it doesn't make sense in looks fine, but it doesn't make sense in the context of some of this should be the context of some of this should be the context of some of this should be the actual footage and some of it should the actual footage and some of it should the actual footage and some of it should be the changed area. I'm actually going be the changed area. I'm actually going be the changed area. I'm actually going to take this geometry that we made and to take this geometry that we made and to take this geometry that we made and separate it into two parts. One part is separate it into two parts. One part is separate it into two parts. One part is the one with all the particles and one the one with all the particles and one the one with all the particles and one part is without. Maybe this big face part is without. Maybe this big face part is without. Maybe this big face right here and then this back wall and right here and then this back wall and right here and then this back wall and this back wall. Whatever we select, I'm this back wall. Whatever we select, I'm this back wall. Whatever we select, I'm going to run a separate by selection. So going to run a separate by selection. So going to run a separate by selection. So that this is now its own separate object that this is now its own separate object that this is now its own separate object that's going to get its own material. It that's going to get its own material. It that's going to get its own material. It doesn't need its geometry nodes. You can doesn't need its geometry nodes. You can doesn't need its geometry nodes. You can see some areas have points and some see some areas have points and some see some areas have points and some don't. But then our key issue is this don't. But then our key issue is this don't. But then our key issue is this section should be projecting the movie section should be projecting the movie section should be projecting the movie clip. We do that by creating a new clip. We do that by creating a new clip. We do that by creating a new material. I'm going to call that material. I'm going to call that material. I'm going to call that projection. And its only purpose is it's projection. And its only purpose is it's projection. And its only purpose is it's going to put the footage back in. So I'm going to put the footage back in. So I'm going to put the footage back in. So I'm going to bring in the movie clip, which going to bring in the movie clip, which going to bring in the movie clip, which I guess needs to be an image texture. I guess needs to be an image texture. I guess needs to be an image texture. Import in the movie clip. It's going to Import in the movie clip. It's going to Import in the movie clip. It's going to be something like I don't know like 300 be something like I don't know like 300 be something like I don't know like 300 frames or whatever. Turn on auto frames or whatever. Turn on auto frames or whatever. Turn on auto refresh, which is going to let it, you refresh, which is going to let it, you refresh, which is going to let it, you know, change every single frame. So know, change every single frame. So know, change every single frame. So there it's playing. And then obviously there it's playing. And then obviously there it's playing. And then obviously it's jank. That's because its coordinate it's jank. That's because its coordinate it's jank. That's because its coordinate system that it's using is UV system that it's using is UV system that it's using is UV coordinates. We instead want to use coordinates. We instead want to use coordinates. We instead want to use something called, so these are UV something called, so these are UV something called, so these are UV coordinates. We want to use something coordinates. We want to use something coordinates. We want to use something called window coordinates. I look at the called window coordinates. I look at the called window coordinates. I look at the image, I use windowed coordinates. And image, I use windowed coordinates. And image, I use windowed coordinates. And now we get that nice, in this case, now we get that nice, in this case, now we get that nice, in this case, repeated projection. You want to set repeated projection. You want to set repeated projection. You want to set this to mirror so that the seam isn't as this to mirror so that the seam isn't as this to mirror so that the seam isn't as obvious. Either way, I don't want to see obvious. Either way, I don't want to see obvious. Either way, I don't want to see any of that junk. So, let's hide that. any of that junk. So, let's hide that. any of that junk. So, let's hide that. How do I do that? Viewport display How do I do that? Viewport display How do I do that? Viewport display passer part two. Yeah. So, as I play passer part two. Yeah. So, as I play passer part two. Yeah. So, as I play this, we move out. Great. And then this this, we move out. Great. And then this this, we move out. Great. And then this area is nice and tracked. Amazing. area is nice and tracked. Amazing. area is nice and tracked. Amazing. Obviously, there's a lot of fine-tuning Obviously, there's a lot of fine-tuning Obviously, there's a lot of fine-tuning to do, but that is a pretty good start. to do, but that is a pretty good start. to do, but that is a pretty good start. If you get any pokies, like right here, If you get any pokies, like right here, If you get any pokies, like right here, this is poking out. All you need to do this is poking out. All you need to do this is poking out. All you need to do is just roughly edit it. So, I'm just is just roughly edit it. So, I'm just is just roughly edit it. So, I'm just going to take a point. I'm going to going to take a point. I'm going to going to take a point. I'm going to shift it. That is what's called a fix. shift it. That is what's called a fix. shift it. That is what's called a fix. These faces shouldn't be here. So, I'm These faces shouldn't be here. So, I'm These faces shouldn't be here. So, I'm going to delete those faces. And going to delete those faces. And going to delete those faces. And instead, I'm going to use this instead, I'm going to use this instead, I'm going to use this projection surface. So, I'm just going projection surface. So, I'm just going projection surface. So, I'm just going to do one of those. That's good enough to do one of those. That's good enough to do one of those. That's good enough for the purposes of this. Great. Uh, for the purposes of this. Great. Uh, for the purposes of this. Great. Uh, okay. I think one final thing is this is okay. I think one final thing is this is okay. I think one final thing is this is a bit too shiny, this black void. I like a bit too shiny, this black void. I like a bit too shiny, this black void. I like that it's reflecting some of the that it's reflecting some of the that it's reflecting some of the original footage, but let's bring up the original footage, but let's bring up the original footage, but let's bring up the roughness and bring down the specular. roughness and bring down the specular. roughness and bring down the specular. And in compositing, we're going to make And in compositing, we're going to make And in compositing, we're going to make this look fine. You'll see in the this look fine. You'll see in the this look fine. You'll see in the original, I have these like glowing line original, I have these like glowing line original, I have these like glowing line things that I didn't explain. The way I things that I didn't explain. The way I things that I didn't explain. The way I did them is I basically took our did them is I basically took our did them is I basically took our geonodes thing. I did a duplicate. This geonodes thing. I did a duplicate. This geonodes thing. I did a duplicate. This duplicate, we don't need the geonodes duplicate, we don't need the geonodes duplicate, we don't need the geonodes for. So, we just have this geometry for. So, we just have this geometry for. So, we just have this geometry again. And then all I did is in edit again. And then all I did is in edit again. And then all I did is in edit mode, I isolated the edges that I wanted mode, I isolated the edges that I wanted mode, I isolated the edges that I wanted this effect on. So, I don't know, I'm this effect on. So, I don't know, I'm this effect on. So, I don't know, I'm just selecting some random ones. We'll just selecting some random ones. We'll just selecting some random ones. We'll call this good enough. So, what you do call this good enough. So, what you do call this good enough. So, what you do is once you select the edges, we want to is once you select the edges, we want to is once you select the edges, we want to isolate them. I'm going to hit Ctrl I to isolate them. I'm going to hit Ctrl I to isolate them. I'm going to hit Ctrl I to invert the selection. And I'm going to invert the selection. And I'm going to invert the selection. And I'm going to delete only only edges and faces, right? delete only only edges and faces, right? delete only only edges and faces, right? Something like that. So now we have our Something like that. So now we have our Something like that. So now we have our edges nice and isolated. And you can see edges nice and isolated. And you can see edges nice and isolated. And you can see they make these loops isn't correct cuz they make these loops isn't correct cuz they make these loops isn't correct cuz they don't close. But something like they don't close. But something like they don't close. But something like that. And then this can get its own nice that. And then this can get its own nice that. And then this can get its own nice uh geometry nodes. All I need to do is I uh geometry nodes. All I need to do is I uh geometry nodes. All I need to do is I need to make a curve that pulses and need to make a curve that pulses and need to make a curve that pulses and glows and whatever. I'm going to run a glows and whatever. I'm going to run a glows and whatever. I'm going to run a mesh to curve. And the only reason I do mesh to curve. And the only reason I do mesh to curve. And the only reason I do that is then we go back into a mesh. I'm that is then we go back into a mesh. I'm that is then we go back into a mesh. I'm going to use my tube node. I dare not going to use my tube node. I dare not going to use my tube node. I dare not use the default one. I hate it. What is use the default one. I hate it. What is use the default one. I hate it. What is this? This is useless to me. So I'm this? This is useless to me. So I'm this? This is useless to me. So I'm going to use the free one from my going to use the free one from my going to use the free one from my website. You don't need to pay a thing. website. You don't need to pay a thing. website. You don't need to pay a thing. You can just grab it from cgmatter.com. You can just grab it from cgmatter.com. You can just grab it from cgmatter.com. Take this curve tube node. Connect that Take this curve tube node. Connect that Take this curve tube node. Connect that in here. Now we got some beakness. Make in here. Now we got some beakness. Make in here. Now we got some beakness. Make it tinier. Even tinier. And now once we it tinier. Even tinier. And now once we it tinier. Even tinier. And now once we set up our scene, you can see we have set up our scene, you can see we have set up our scene, you can see we have our nice edges. They're the boundary our nice edges. They're the boundary our nice edges. They're the boundary between the projection and the void between the projection and the void between the projection and the void thing. Add a set material node to our thing. Add a set material node to our thing. Add a set material node to our border curves. That should get a new border curves. That should get a new border curves. That should get a new material that I'm going to call edges. material that I'm going to call edges. material that I'm going to call edges. Put that in there. As a baseline, I'm Put that in there. As a baseline, I'm Put that in there. As a baseline, I'm just going to use a emission just so you just going to use a emission just so you just going to use a emission just so you can see the nice boundary. That'll be can see the nice boundary. That'll be can see the nice boundary. That'll be orange and glowing and whatever. But the orange and glowing and whatever. But the orange and glowing and whatever. But the trick to make it look interesting is it trick to make it look interesting is it trick to make it look interesting is it needs to do this pulsing thing that you needs to do this pulsing thing that you needs to do this pulsing thing that you see. And I didn't do this with geometry. see. And I didn't do this with geometry. see. And I didn't do this with geometry. That's just pure shader magic. All I did That's just pure shader magic. All I did That's just pure shader magic. All I did is I stored an attribute of the spline is I stored an attribute of the spline is I stored an attribute of the spline parameter which tells us how far along parameter which tells us how far along parameter which tells us how far along the curve are we. In other words, 0 to the curve are we. In other words, 0 to the curve are we. In other words, 0 to one, we loop it. 0 to 1, 0 to 1, 0 to 1. one, we loop it. 0 to 1, 0 to 1, 0 to 1. one, we loop it. 0 to 1, 0 to 1, 0 to 1. So that's useful information. I'm going So that's useful information. I'm going So that's useful information. I'm going to call this our spline. In the to call this our spline. In the to call this our spline. In the material, you can bring in this material, you can bring in this material, you can bring in this attribute. So I called it spline. Little attribute. So I called it spline. Little attribute. So I called it spline. Little hard to see, but you can see it starts hard to see, but you can see it starts hard to see, but you can see it starts black and then it goes to white at the black and then it goes to white at the black and then it goes to white at the very top. If I connect this to the very top. If I connect this to the very top. If I connect this to the emission, it's going to get, you know, emission, it's going to get, you know, emission, it's going to get, you know, stronger as it gets to the end. But to stronger as it gets to the end. But to stronger as it gets to the end. But to get this to do a nice looping, literally get this to do a nice looping, literally get this to do a nice looping, literally all I did is I multiplied it by a all I did is I multiplied it by a all I did is I multiplied it by a number. Let's say it's 10 iterations. number. Let's say it's 10 iterations. number. Let's say it's 10 iterations. It's going 0 to 10. And then the trick I It's going 0 to 10. And then the trick I It's going 0 to 10. And then the trick I always talk about is throwing it through always talk about is throwing it through always talk about is throwing it through a fraction, which I need to zoom out to a fraction, which I need to zoom out to a fraction, which I need to zoom out to actually see. And now it goes 0 to 1, 0 actually see. And now it goes 0 to 1, 0 actually see. And now it goes 0 to 1, 0 to 1, 0 to 1, 10 times 0 all the way up to 1, 0 to 1, 10 times 0 all the way up to 1, 0 to 1, 10 times 0 all the way up to one. And then it's immediately zero to one. And then it's immediately zero to one. And then it's immediately zero again. I just want to add some again. I just want to add some again. I just want to add some smoothing. So I'm going to use a color smoothing. So I'm going to use a color smoothing. So I'm going to use a color ramp. No, I'm going to use a float ramp. No, I'm going to use a float ramp. No, I'm going to use a float curve. Even easier. have this be curve. Even easier. have this be curve. Even easier. have this be symmetric about the middle but with a symmetric about the middle but with a symmetric about the middle but with a bit of fade. Something like that. Before bit of fade. Something like that. Before bit of fade. Something like that. Before and after. I'm going to take this and after. I'm going to take this and after. I'm going to take this output. I'm going to make it much output. I'm going to make it much output. I'm going to make it much stronger. So maybe it's like three times stronger. So maybe it's like three times stronger. So maybe it's like three times as bright or whatever. And then the as bright or whatever. And then the as bright or whatever. And then the final trick to have this move over time final trick to have this move over time final trick to have this move over time is remember we're taking whatever we put is remember we're taking whatever we put is remember we're taking whatever we put in 0 to 10 and then we make it a in 0 to 10 and then we make it a in 0 to 10 and then we make it a decimal. If I use a addition, what I'm decimal. If I use a addition, what I'm decimal. If I use a addition, what I'm essentially doing is I'm offsetting it. essentially doing is I'm offsetting it. essentially doing is I'm offsetting it. If we have this animate over time, we're If we have this animate over time, we're If we have this animate over time, we're good to go. And because I don't think good to go. And because I don't think good to go. And because I don't think there's a time node, as far as I know, there's a time node, as far as I know, there's a time node, as far as I know, I'm just going to use a driver. So hash I'm just going to use a driver. So hash I'm just going to use a driver. So hash frame gives us the frame number. So, frame gives us the frame number. So, frame gives us the frame number. So, frame 1 2 3 4 5 whatever. You're not frame 1 2 3 4 5 whatever. You're not frame 1 2 3 4 5 whatever. You're not going to be able to see it cuz it's so going to be able to see it cuz it's so going to be able to see it cuz it's so fast. It's going wahoo wah wah w. You fast. It's going wahoo wah wah w. You fast. It's going wahoo wah wah w. You want to take this, divide it by 20. And want to take this, divide it by 20. And want to take this, divide it by 20. And you can see that's a pretty good speed. you can see that's a pretty good speed. you can see that's a pretty good speed. Maybe divide by 25. The bigger the Maybe divide by 25. The bigger the Maybe divide by 25. The bigger the denominator, the slower it will go. And denominator, the slower it will go. And denominator, the slower it will go. And then to make it less cringe, just make then to make it less cringe, just make then to make it less cringe, just make it much much thinner. The reason it it much much thinner. The reason it it much much thinner. The reason it looks weird is cuz it's huge. So that looks weird is cuz it's huge. So that looks weird is cuz it's huge. So that no, even thinner. Like it should be real no, even thinner. Like it should be real no, even thinner. Like it should be real tiny. All the good stuff happens in tiny. All the good stuff happens in tiny. All the good stuff happens in compositing. So speaking of which, let's compositing. So speaking of which, let's compositing. So speaking of which, let's do a composite. Only things you need to do a composite. Only things you need to do a composite. Only things you need to set up is in the render tab under color set up is in the render tab under color set up is in the render tab under color management. I'm going to set this to management. I'm going to set this to management. I'm going to set this to standard just because I'm projecting the standard just because I'm projecting the standard just because I'm projecting the footage and I don't want to mess with footage and I don't want to mess with footage and I don't want to mess with it. And then for the render passes, uh it. And then for the render passes, uh it. And then for the render passes, uh the main important ones is I want the main important ones is I want the main important ones is I want ambient occlusion. I definitely want a ambient occlusion. I definitely want a ambient occlusion. I definitely want a cryptomat maybe by object just to keep cryptomat maybe by object just to keep cryptomat maybe by object just to keep it simple. So I can say do I want to it simple. So I can say do I want to it simple. So I can say do I want to affect the edges, the original footage, affect the edges, the original footage, affect the edges, the original footage, the floaties. Let's do a thousand sample the floaties. Let's do a thousand sample the floaties. Let's do a thousand sample render. It's going to go surprisingly render. It's going to go surprisingly render. It's going to go surprisingly fast. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. fast. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. fast. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Especially with motion blur and Especially with motion blur and Especially with motion blur and everything. Let's get like a a frame everything. Let's get like a a frame everything. Let's get like a a frame with a lot of movement. Like that one with a lot of movement. Like that one with a lot of movement. Like that one over there. That looks nice. So, let's over there. That looks nice. So, let's over there. That looks nice. So, let's go over like the super basic version of go over like the super basic version of go over like the super basic version of the compositing I did. The first thing the compositing I did. The first thing the compositing I did. The first thing you're going to see here is that we have you're going to see here is that we have you're going to see here is that we have the render, but I can't really the render, but I can't really the render, but I can't really distinguish. If you look at the alpha, distinguish. If you look at the alpha, distinguish. If you look at the alpha, it's all white. I can't really it's all white. I can't really it's all white. I can't really distinguish between the objects. So, distinguish between the objects. So, distinguish between the objects. So, that is what the cryptomat's for. I'm that is what the cryptomat's for. I'm that is what the cryptomat's for. I'm going to add a cryptomat node. If I going to add a cryptomat node. If I going to add a cryptomat node. If I cycle through this to pick projection is cycle through this to pick projection is cycle through this to pick projection is pink. We have the column. We have that pink. We have the column. We have that pink. We have the column. We have that little thing over here. I'm going to little thing over here. I'm going to little thing over here. I'm going to select the projection, which you're select the projection, which you're select the projection, which you're going to see is going to isolate that going to see is going to isolate that going to see is going to isolate that area. And if I add in the image, we area. And if I add in the image, we area. And if I add in the image, we don't need to. It will show that part of don't need to. It will show that part of don't need to. It will show that part of the image. I'm going to take this mat the image. I'm going to take this mat the image. I'm going to take this mat and what I actually want to do is I want and what I actually want to do is I want and what I actually want to do is I want to invert it. I want everything except to invert it. I want everything except to invert it. I want everything except the footage. The reason for that is all the footage. The reason for that is all the footage. The reason for that is all of this stuff that we made is perfectly of this stuff that we made is perfectly of this stuff that we made is perfectly rendered. It's nice. It's sharp. I mean, rendered. It's nice. It's sharp. I mean, rendered. It's nice. It's sharp. I mean, yeah, there's motion blur, but it's yeah, there's motion blur, but it's yeah, there's motion blur, but it's perfect. Whereas, this was shot with a perfect. Whereas, this was shot with a perfect. Whereas, this was shot with a piece of iPhone potato. So, I want piece of iPhone potato. So, I want piece of iPhone potato. So, I want to match that. It should look like this to match that. It should look like this to match that. It should look like this is also shot with a piece of iPhone is also shot with a piece of iPhone is also shot with a piece of iPhone potato. In other words, if I want to do potato. In other words, if I want to do potato. In other words, if I want to do something like a pixelate, for example, something like a pixelate, for example, something like a pixelate, for example, where as I bring this up, you can see, where as I bring this up, you can see, where as I bring this up, you can see, oh, it's more pixelated. That should oh, it's more pixelated. That should oh, it's more pixelated. That should only be affecting the render, not the only be affecting the render, not the only be affecting the render, not the projection part of it. Let's do a projection part of it. Let's do a projection part of it. Let's do a pixelate of two. So if I zoom in before, pixelate of two. So if I zoom in before, pixelate of two. So if I zoom in before, after. And then another thing that after. And then another thing that after. And then another thing that really just makes it look disgusting. A really just makes it look disgusting. A really just makes it look disgusting. A trick I like is the Kuwahara filter. trick I like is the Kuwahara filter. trick I like is the Kuwahara filter. Let's just start with the Kuahara Let's just start with the Kuahara Let's just start with the Kuahara without pixelated and just see what that without pixelated and just see what that without pixelated and just see what that looks like. So that's just pure mush. Go looks like. So that's just pure mush. Go looks like. So that's just pure mush. Go to end panel, go to options, turn on GPU to end panel, go to options, turn on GPU to end panel, go to options, turn on GPU if you have a good GPU, that'll make it if you have a good GPU, that'll make it if you have a good GPU, that'll make it faster. So you can see as I increase faster. So you can see as I increase faster. So you can see as I increase this, just pure mush. And then with the this, just pure mush. And then with the this, just pure mush. And then with the pixelate as well, maybe it should be pixelate as well, maybe it should be pixelate as well, maybe it should be after. Yeah, that's mush. So before, after. Yeah, that's mush. So before, after. Yeah, that's mush. So before, after. And now I want to say only apply after. And now I want to say only apply after. And now I want to say only apply this to this part of the render because this to this part of the render because this to this part of the render because this also breaks our our like you know this also breaks our our like you know this also breaks our our like you know the part that we like our projection. the part that we like our projection. the part that we like our projection. The idea now is I'm going to mix color The idea now is I'm going to mix color The idea now is I'm going to mix color between the original stuff and then this between the original stuff and then this between the original stuff and then this stuff. I'm going to copy my render stuff. I'm going to copy my render stuff. I'm going to copy my render layers over. We're going to have this. layers over. We're going to have this. layers over. We're going to have this. We're going to have the pixelated We're going to have the pixelated We're going to have the pixelated version. And then the way we mix between version. And then the way we mix between version. And then the way we mix between them is with this invert color. So let's them is with this invert color. So let's them is with this invert color. So let's see what that looks like. So now if I see what that looks like. So now if I see what that looks like. So now if I flicker this on and off, you can see the flicker this on and off, you can see the flicker this on and off, you can see the mush, but it's not affecting our mush, but it's not affecting our mush, but it's not affecting our footage. We also need to match the black footage. We also need to match the black footage. We also need to match the black so it doesn't get too bright or too dark so it doesn't get too bright or too dark so it doesn't get too bright or too dark or whatever. The darkest part of this or whatever. The darkest part of this or whatever. The darkest part of this image is probably down here. And that image is probably down here. And that image is probably down here. And that black is more like a brown. If I click black is more like a brown. If I click black is more like a brown. If I click and hover over this, you can see all and hover over this, you can see all and hover over this, you can see all these numbers, these RGs and B's are these numbers, these RGs and B's are these numbers, these RGs and B's are actually the value. You can see that actually the value. You can see that actually the value. You can see that never dips below like 0.05 or 006. never dips below like 0.05 or 006. never dips below like 0.05 or 006. Whereas our render render can go down to Whereas our render render can go down to Whereas our render render can go down to 0.005. I'm going to take the brightness 0.005. I'm going to take the brightness 0.005. I'm going to take the brightness and contrast. And I'm just going to add and contrast. And I'm just going to add and contrast. And I'm just going to add some brightness to it. And the amount of some brightness to it. And the amount of some brightness to it. And the amount of brightness I want to add is just so that brightness I want to add is just so that brightness I want to add is just so that our mush turns into around 0.05 value or our mush turns into around 0.05 value or our mush turns into around 0.05 value or luminance. So let's do a brightness of luminance. So let's do a brightness of luminance. So let's do a brightness of like.3. What does that give us? 0.04. 04 like.3. What does that give us? 0.04. 04 like.3. What does that give us? 0.04. 04 almost. Let's bring it up just a little. almost. Let's bring it up just a little. almost. Let's bring it up just a little. Yeah. 0.05. So this is the before and Yeah. 0.05. So this is the before and Yeah. 0.05. So this is the before and the after. I don't know if that comes the after. I don't know if that comes the after. I don't know if that comes through on YouTube, but it makes it through on YouTube, but it makes it through on YouTube, but it makes it blend in a bit better. I'm going to blend in a bit better. I'm going to blend in a bit better. I'm going to bring it down just a little just as a bring it down just a little just as a bring it down just a little just as a stylistic thing so it looks more like a stylistic thing so it looks more like a stylistic thing so it looks more like a void. And we haven't even added our void. And we haven't even added our void. And we haven't even added our glare shmears. So we should do that. We glare shmears. So we should do that. We glare shmears. So we should do that. We should add our glare shmears. I'm going should add our glare shmears. I'm going should add our glare shmears. I'm going to do a glare node, which I'm actually to do a glare node, which I'm actually to do a glare node, which I'm actually going to isolate into its own chain. If going to isolate into its own chain. If going to isolate into its own chain. If we isolate it, you can see the edges are we isolate it, you can see the edges are we isolate it, you can see the edges are being affected the most. I'm going to being affected the most. I'm going to being affected the most. I'm going to set this to bloom cuz I like that kind set this to bloom cuz I like that kind set this to bloom cuz I like that kind of thing. And then you can just play of thing. And then you can just play of thing. And then you can just play around with the threshold like what does around with the threshold like what does around with the threshold like what does and doesn't count as a glare. But you're and doesn't count as a glare. But you're and doesn't count as a glare. But you're going to see very importantly it's also going to see very importantly it's also going to see very importantly it's also glaring up our original footage which glaring up our original footage which glaring up our original footage which that should be locked right the that should be locked right the that should be locked right the projection part. So there might be a projection part. So there might be a projection part. So there might be a clean way to do this but without clean way to do this but without clean way to do this but without thinking too hard about it what I can do thinking too hard about it what I can do thinking too hard about it what I can do is I can set alpha on this footage such is I can set alpha on this footage such is I can set alpha on this footage such that it's using our mask. So now you can that it's using our mask. So now you can that it's using our mask. So now you can see we've perfectly isolated the render see we've perfectly isolated the render see we've perfectly isolated the render before after. This is what's going to before after. This is what's going to before after. This is what's going to get the glare. Let's make that really get the glare. Let's make that really get the glare. Let's make that really intense. So like five times stronger or intense. So like five times stronger or intense. So like five times stronger or whatever. I take my mush thing. I throw whatever. I take my mush thing. I throw whatever. I take my mush thing. I throw it through a mix color with an add which it through a mix color with an add which it through a mix color with an add which basically says take some light and add basically says take some light and add basically says take some light and add to it not the full footage but just the to it not the full footage but just the to it not the full footage but just the glare components. So the glare view it glare components. So the glare view it glare components. So the glare view it before after you can set it as high as before after you can set it as high as before after you can set it as high as you want. And we can also like uh you want. And we can also like uh you want. And we can also like uh saturate it, desaturate it, make it like saturate it, desaturate it, make it like saturate it, desaturate it, make it like red just to compare original footage red just to compare original footage red just to compare original footage composite original footage composite. composite original footage composite. composite original footage composite. You can't pretend like it doesn't fit in You can't pretend like it doesn't fit in You can't pretend like it doesn't fit in better. And there's so much more we can better. And there's so much more we can better. And there's so much more we can do to like match um lighting or do to like match um lighting or do to like match um lighting or whatever. But I think one thing that whatever. But I think one thing that whatever. But I think one thing that would help a lot is the transition would help a lot is the transition would help a lot is the transition between these. So, I'm talking not between these. So, I'm talking not between these. So, I'm talking not really about the edge here. The first really about the edge here. The first really about the edge here. The first part of the footage where it goes from part of the footage where it goes from part of the footage where it goes from render to projection that could blend in render to projection that could blend in render to projection that could blend in a bit better. What I suggest is we take a bit better. What I suggest is we take a bit better. What I suggest is we take our projection, which we already have a our projection, which we already have a our projection, which we already have a mask for, but I want to isolate just the mask for, but I want to isolate just the mask for, but I want to isolate just the boundary over here. So, I'm going to do boundary over here. So, I'm going to do boundary over here. So, I'm going to do a erode dilate. What that does is it a erode dilate. What that does is it a erode dilate. What that does is it lets you dilate, in other words, make lets you dilate, in other words, make lets you dilate, in other words, make bigger, or erode, in other words, make bigger, or erode, in other words, make bigger, or erode, in other words, make smaller. I'm going to take the original smaller. I'm going to take the original smaller. I'm going to take the original mat and subtract away the shrunk mat and subtract away the shrunk mat and subtract away the shrunk version, which gives us the edge. I took version, which gives us the edge. I took version, which gives us the edge. I took the thing, got rid of the stuff in the the thing, got rid of the stuff in the the thing, got rid of the stuff in the middle, now it's the edge. subtract the middle, now it's the edge. subtract the middle, now it's the edge. subtract the dilate erode version. I would recommend dilate erode version. I would recommend dilate erode version. I would recommend setting this to feather or something. setting this to feather or something. setting this to feather or something. And now we can do any kind of edit to And now we can do any kind of edit to And now we can do any kind of edit to this area, which remember is the this area, which remember is the this area, which remember is the projection area. Maybe before we add the projection area. Maybe before we add the projection area. Maybe before we add the glare or whatever. One thing I can do is glare or whatever. One thing I can do is glare or whatever. One thing I can do is I can run a hue saturation value which I can run a hue saturation value which I can run a hue saturation value which lets me saturate. It lets me do lets me saturate. It lets me do lets me saturate. It lets me do whatever. But I'm going to do it only on whatever. But I'm going to do it only on whatever. But I'm going to do it only on this area, this mask, which is the this area, this mask, which is the this area, this mask, which is the factor. So now if I saturate it, you can factor. So now if I saturate it, you can factor. So now if I saturate it, you can see it's only on those edges. And I'm see it's only on those edges. And I'm see it's only on those edges. And I'm going to dilate a bit more so that it going to dilate a bit more so that it going to dilate a bit more so that it eats more into this. I think bumping up eats more into this. I think bumping up eats more into this. I think bumping up the saturation is nice even if it's a the saturation is nice even if it's a the saturation is nice even if it's a bit crispy and maybe bringing down the bit crispy and maybe bringing down the bit crispy and maybe bringing down the value. Change the hue. So before and value. Change the hue. So before and value. Change the hue. So before and after just a bit of a integration. And after just a bit of a integration. And after just a bit of a integration. And then if you want the the compositor then if you want the the compositor then if you want the the compositor nightmare the the mark of a novice is nightmare the the mark of a novice is nightmare the the mark of a novice is take lens distortion throw it over the take lens distortion throw it over the take lens distortion throw it over the entire thing. Boom. Now it distorts as entire thing. Boom. Now it distorts as entire thing. Boom. Now it distorts as one which in a way makes it look more one which in a way makes it look more one which in a way makes it look more integrated because everything's being integrated because everything's being integrated because everything's being distorted by the same amount. What if I distorted by the same amount. What if I distorted by the same amount. What if I distort negative but just a little? distort negative but just a little? distort negative but just a little? Something like that. Before after. I Something like that. Before after. I Something like that. Before after. I mean that's actually quite a lot. Let's mean that's actually quite a lot. Let's mean that's actually quite a lot. Let's divide by two again. I mean, this might divide by two again. I mean, this might divide by two again. I mean, this might sell the illusion a little more, right? sell the illusion a little more, right? sell the illusion a little more, right? And done dispersion. People go crazy on And done dispersion. People go crazy on And done dispersion. People go crazy on the dispersion. They do. Really, you the dispersion. They do. Really, you the dispersion. They do. Really, you should only be doing dispersion on the should only be doing dispersion on the should only be doing dispersion on the render, not on the projection, cuz that render, not on the projection, cuz that render, not on the projection, cuz that already has chromatic aberration, but already has chromatic aberration, but already has chromatic aberration, but whatever. I'll add some like 0.01. I'm whatever. I'll add some like 0.01. I'm whatever. I'll add some like 0.01. I'm talking real subtle. So, this adds a talking real subtle. So, this adds a talking real subtle. So, this adds a little something something. One thing I little something something. One thing I little something something. One thing I learned is instead of flicking between learned is instead of flicking between learned is instead of flicking between these, one thing you can do is there's a these, one thing you can do is there's a these, one thing you can do is there's a split node. And what it does is it lets split node. And what it does is it lets split node. And what it does is it lets you transition between two things. So, you transition between two things. So, you transition between two things. So, I'm going to kind of rotate it so you I'm going to kind of rotate it so you I'm going to kind of rotate it so you can go back and forth. I don't believe can go back and forth. I don't believe can go back and forth. I don't believe it has a controller. Does it? It does. it has a controller. Does it? It does. it has a controller. Does it? It does. does have a controller. So, I put in does have a controller. So, I put in does have a controller. So, I put in these two pieces of footage and this these two pieces of footage and this these two pieces of footage and this will let me well I can just move up will let me well I can just move up will let me well I can just move up here. This will let me kind of look at here. This will let me kind of look at here. This will let me kind of look at this before and after just kind of this before and after just kind of this before and after just kind of judge. If I zoom in at this pillar, you judge. If I zoom in at this pillar, you judge. If I zoom in at this pillar, you can see how much better integrated it can see how much better integrated it can see how much better integrated it looks like. You know, some things I looks like. You know, some things I looks like. You know, some things I didn't really do here is the radius of didn't really do here is the radius of didn't really do here is the radius of these should be pulsing and whatever. these should be pulsing and whatever. these should be pulsing and whatever. But I think this is like that 80% of the But I think this is like that 80% of the But I think this is like that 80% of the way there, 20% experiment and then way there, 20% experiment and then way there, 20% experiment and then refine. I hope you liked it. Goodbye.
