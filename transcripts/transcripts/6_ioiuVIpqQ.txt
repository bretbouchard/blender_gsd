Hello everyone and welcome to today's Hello everyone and welcome to today's Hello everyone and welcome to today's live stream where I'm going to be going live stream where I'm going to be going live stream where I'm going to be going over some new stuff in Blender 5.1 and over some new stuff in Blender 5.1 and over some new stuff in Blender 5.1 and just making a little project that I just making a little project that I just making a little project that I wanted to make on the side. So, first wanted to make on the side. So, first wanted to make on the side. So, first thing that we can see right here is that thing that we can see right here is that thing that we can see right here is that I have a grid that is doing a volume I have a grid that is doing a volume I have a grid that is doing a volume simulation, but it only has one simulation, but it only has one simulation, but it only has one dimension using the new cube grid dimension using the new cube grid dimension using the new cube grid topology node. Oh, also before I get too topology node. Oh, also before I get too topology node. Oh, also before I get too ahead of myself, uh I forgot to check ahead of myself, uh I forgot to check ahead of myself, uh I forgot to check when the Blender 5.1 beta happens. So when the Blender 5.1 beta happens. So when the Blender 5.1 beta happens. So that's when new features are frozen and that's when new features are frozen and that's when new features are frozen and they just work on bug fixing until it they just work on bug fixing until it they just work on bug fixing until it actually comes out. So next th or this actually comes out. So next th or this actually comes out. So next th or this upcoming Thursday, there will be no new upcoming Thursday, there will be no new upcoming Thursday, there will be no new features, which uh lists will not be in features, which uh lists will not be in features, which uh lists will not be in Blender 5.1. I thought we had more time Blender 5.1. I thought we had more time Blender 5.1. I thought we had more time to work on that kind of stuff before it to work on that kind of stuff before it to work on that kind of stuff before it came out. Uh I have some notes I want to came out. Uh I have some notes I want to came out. Uh I have some notes I want to make for that but uh yeah there is not make for that but uh yeah there is not make for that but uh yeah there is not enough not enough time and I did not enough not enough time and I did not enough not enough time and I did not know I should have checked that weeks know I should have checked that weeks know I should have checked that weeks ago. But yes, uh, beyond that, there are ago. But yes, uh, beyond that, there are ago. But yes, uh, beyond that, there are some very cool nodes coming in Blender some very cool nodes coming in Blender some very cool nodes coming in Blender 5.1. One of them being the cube grid 5.1. One of them being the cube grid 5.1. One of them being the cube grid topology node where we can just set the topology node where we can just set the topology node where we can just set the resolutions and it just gives us a base resolutions and it just gives us a base resolutions and it just gives us a base grid that just a boolean which I believe grid that just a boolean which I believe grid that just a boolean which I believe is set to true by default which just is set to true by default which just is set to true by default which just gives a framework for other grids. gives a framework for other grids. gives a framework for other grids. So in this case I set the cube grid So in this case I set the cube grid So in this case I set the cube grid topology. I set the transform so that topology. I set the transform so that topology. I set the transform so that all the squares are even because the all the squares are even because the all the squares are even because the advect uh velocity node needs it which I advect uh velocity node needs it which I advect uh velocity node needs it which I forget if I even use that further down forget if I even use that further down forget if I even use that further down the line. And then I multiply it by zero the line. And then I multiply it by zero the line. And then I multiply it by zero and then I add to one of the smoke grids and then I add to one of the smoke grids and then I add to one of the smoke grids because grids are their own they're they because grids are their own they're they because grids are their own they're they don't need to be attached to geometry don't need to be attached to geometry don't need to be attached to geometry until you want to set a material. So until you want to set a material. So until you want to set a material. So this is just being passed along and then this is just being passed along and then this is just being passed along and then I do the actual simulation which I'll I do the actual simulation which I'll I do the actual simulation which I'll give a brief breakdown. This is from uh give a brief breakdown. This is from uh give a brief breakdown. This is from uh Sean Trelli I believe the name is though Sean Trelli I believe the name is though Sean Trelli I believe the name is though I could be pronouncing that very wrong. I could be pronouncing that very wrong. I could be pronouncing that very wrong. I add to the velocity every simulation I add to the velocity every simulation I add to the velocity every simulation step. I add vect to the velocity using step. I add vect to the velocity using step. I add vect to the velocity using this setup so that it'll wrap around this setup so that it'll wrap around this setup so that it'll wrap around borders as we can see giving that borders as we can see giving that borders as we can see giving that infinite simulation look. And yeah infinite simulation look. And yeah infinite simulation look. And yeah that's the advct setup. Multiplying that's the advct setup. Multiplying that's the advct setup. Multiplying [music] this by zero on the Z because we [music] this by zero on the Z because we [music] this by zero on the Z because we don't want it moving outside of the don't want it moving outside of the don't want it moving outside of the thing. the divergence in this case I'm thing. the divergence in this case I'm thing. the divergence in this case I'm using grid divergence but you need to using grid divergence but you need to using grid divergence but you need to multiply it by like the amount of voxels multiply it by like the amount of voxels multiply it by like the amount of voxels but I don't know the how to do that but I don't know the how to do that but I don't know the how to do that exactly so just set it to how it feels exactly so just set it to how it feels exactly so just set it to how it feels what feels right you could do it either what feels right you could do it either what feels right you could do it either by sampling the grid floats in this case by sampling the grid floats in this case by sampling the grid floats in this case you know you get the box index add to you know you get the box index add to you know you get the box index add to end yada yada so you could do it either end yada yada so you could do it either end yada yada so you could do it either this way but this way is faster by I this way but this way is faster by I this way but this way is faster by I think a few milliseconds think a few milliseconds think a few milliseconds uh for the pressure which happens uh for the pressure which happens uh for the pressure which happens Next, Next, Next, as far as I I need to find if there's a as far as I I need to find if there's a as far as I I need to find if there's a official way of doing this, but for now official way of doing this, but for now official way of doing this, but for now I'm just using the up down left right I'm just using the up down left right I'm just using the up down left right you know add all those together subtract you know add all those together subtract you know add all those together subtract from that divide by four and then you from that divide by four and then you from that divide by four and then you iterate on that that is the most iterate on that that is the most iterate on that that is the most expensive part of this entire operation expensive part of this entire operation expensive part of this entire operation which takes which is four iterations 12 which takes which is four iterations 12 which takes which is four iterations 12 milliseconds I should mention this is milliseconds I should mention this is milliseconds I should mention this is just a 256 256x1 grid and it is still just a 256 256x1 grid and it is still just a 256 256x1 grid and it is still it's slow it's slow maybe it would it's slow it's slow maybe it would it's slow it's slow maybe it would beaster faster to do it on just a beaster faster to do it on just a beaster faster to do it on just a regular mesh, but since this is more regular mesh, but since this is more regular mesh, but since this is more generic, you could just add in a third generic, you could just add in a third generic, you could just add in a third dimension and it should be pretty much dimension and it should be pretty much dimension and it should be pretty much fine. fine. fine. Yeah. And then you subtract the pressure Yeah. And then you subtract the pressure Yeah. And then you subtract the pressure from the velocity grid, which looks like from the velocity grid, which looks like from the velocity grid, which looks like this. Again, I you need to divide it by this. Again, I you need to divide it by this. Again, I you need to divide it by some sort of voxil count, [music] which some sort of voxil count, [music] which some sort of voxil count, [music] which I'm still not entirely sure. This one is I'm still not entirely sure. This one is I'm still not entirely sure. This one is faster compared to this, which you would faster compared to this, which you would faster compared to this, which you would need to connect that for the third need to connect that for the third need to connect that for the third dimension, yada yada, but you get it. me dimension, yada yada, but you get it. me dimension, yada yada, but you get it. me actually go and organize this a little actually go and organize this a little actually go and organize this a little bit better. bit better. bit better. Let me move that down over to here. Let me move that down over to here. Let me move that down over to here. Yeah, this is only using grids because Yeah, this is only using grids because Yeah, this is only using grids because if you were to store the grids, it would if you were to store the grids, it would if you were to store the grids, it would be less efficient. Uh and then here, be less efficient. Uh and then here, be less efficient. Uh and then here, which this setup is just another advect which this setup is just another advect which this setup is just another advect except add vecting smoke, but this is except add vecting smoke, but this is except add vecting smoke, but this is terribly organized. terribly organized. terribly organized. Move [music] some of the things around, Move [music] some of the things around, Move [music] some of the things around, make it just a little easier to see. I make it just a little easier to see. I make it just a little easier to see. I don't know why I'm multiplying it by one don't know why I'm multiplying it by one don't know why I'm multiplying it by one [music] after the fact. It was probably [music] after the fact. It was probably [music] after the fact. It was probably useful for something. Oh, it was for useful for something. Oh, it was for useful for something. Oh, it was for dissipation, but we don't need that at dissipation, but we don't need that at dissipation, but we don't need that at the moment. the moment. the moment. So, that's the setup for that. So, So, that's the setup for that. So, So, that's the setup for that. So, that's how the grid is set up. Uh, you that's how the grid is set up. Uh, you that's how the grid is set up. Uh, you only need to output the the actual only need to output the the actual only need to output the the actual smoke, the pressure, and the velocity smoke, the pressure, and the velocity smoke, the pressure, and the velocity out there. I forget if you actually need out there. I forget if you actually need out there. I forget if you actually need the pressure or if that's calculated on the pressure or if that's calculated on the pressure or if that's calculated on the fly. the fly. the fly. Uh, the pressure. Yeah. H. Do we even Uh, the pressure. Yeah. H. Do we even Uh, the pressure. Yeah. H. Do we even need the pressure as the input? need the pressure as the input? need the pressure as the input? Maybe. Maybe I could eliminate. We'll Maybe. Maybe I could eliminate. We'll Maybe. Maybe I could eliminate. We'll just see about that. But we might not just see about that. But we might not just see about that. But we might not even have to store that. Yeah, with that even have to store that. Yeah, with that even have to store that. Yeah, with that we can see that the simulation is we can see that the simulation is we can see that the simulation is running quite well. If we look at just running quite well. If we look at just running quite well. If we look at just the grid like this, we can see it looks the grid like this, we can see it looks the grid like this, we can see it looks like that. You know, pretty standard. like that. You know, pretty standard. like that. You know, pretty standard. This part is real time until you try to This part is real time until you try to This part is real time until you try to boxize it. I set the grid background to boxize it. I set the grid background to boxize it. I set the grid background to be negative one so that the volume to be negative one so that the volume to be negative one so that the volume to mesh doesn't flip back and forth. mesh doesn't flip back and forth. mesh doesn't flip back and forth. As we can see, it looks uh looks pretty As we can see, it looks uh looks pretty As we can see, it looks uh looks pretty good. And then I can volume it, shade good. And then I can volume it, shade good. And then I can volume it, shade smooth, set material, and all that good smooth, set material, and all that good smooth, set material, and all that good stuff. So either way, if you want to stuff. So either way, if you want to stuff. So either way, if you want to mesh it or just keep it as volume, both mesh it or just keep it as volume, both mesh it or just keep it as volume, both of those are valid ways of doing it. Let of those are valid ways of doing it. Let of those are valid ways of doing it. Let me connect the volume right here. And we me connect the volume right here. And we me connect the volume right here. And we can see that is working. And we can see can see that is working. And we can see can see that is working. And we can see it looks very orange because of the it looks very orange because of the it looks very orange because of the lights. lights. lights. Yep. So 2D simulations, 2D volume Yep. So 2D simulations, 2D volume Yep. So 2D simulations, 2D volume simulations, which apparently that is simulations, which apparently that is simulations, which apparently that is pretty popular in Houdini because they pretty popular in Houdini because they pretty popular in Houdini because they use that in for like height maps and use that in for like height maps and use that in for like height maps and stuff like that. Options are there. I stuff like that. Options are there. I stuff like that. Options are there. I want to try out more things like want to try out more things like want to try out more things like temperature and stuff like that, but temperature and stuff like that, but temperature and stuff like that, but smoke simulations are still quite heavy smoke simulations are still quite heavy smoke simulations are still quite heavy and I do not have a super powerful CPU, and I do not have a super powerful CPU, and I do not have a super powerful CPU, so I probably won't be dealing too much so I probably won't be dealing too much so I probably won't be dealing too much with that. But it is very cool. I have a with that. But it is very cool. I have a with that. But it is very cool. I have a vision though if we could use the vision though if we could use the vision though if we could use the compositor for stuff like that, that compositor for stuff like that, that compositor for stuff like that, that would be very cool. would be very cool. would be very cool. Yes, for the moment it looks pretty Yes, for the moment it looks pretty Yes, for the moment it looks pretty pretty cool. Uh in terms of other stuff pretty cool. Uh in terms of other stuff pretty cool. Uh in terms of other stuff that is coming in Blender 5.1, let me go that is coming in Blender 5.1, let me go that is coming in Blender 5.1, let me go and and and get the change log so that you all can get the change log so that you all can get the change log so that you all can see see see Firefox. Firefox. Firefox. It's It's It's I'm just going to show you all the I'm just going to show you all the I'm just going to show you all the geometry node change log stuff and maybe geometry node change log stuff and maybe geometry node change log stuff and maybe a few other things browser. browser. browser. Ah, there we go. Okay, so for Blender Ah, there we go. Okay, so for Blender Ah, there we go. Okay, so for Blender mix color now does that. Yep. Pack UV mix color now does that. Yep. Pack UV mix color now does that. Yep. Pack UV islands now has islands now has islands now has let me just zoom in so you can see it a let me just zoom in so you can see it a let me just zoom in so you can see it a bit better. Uh let's see. Inputs to bit better. Uh let's see. Inputs to bit better. Uh let's see. Inputs to define a custom packing region. You can define a custom packing region. You can define a custom packing region. You can search for warnings. UV unwrap has a search for warnings. UV unwrap has a search for warnings. UV unwrap has a slim unwrap option and no flip. Bone slim unwrap option and no flip. Bone slim unwrap option and no flip. Bone info supports rebone transforms. This info supports rebone transforms. This info supports rebone transforms. This will be useful when we get lists. So, at will be useful when we get lists. So, at will be useful when we get lists. So, at the moment, you can get one bone or a the moment, you can get one bone or a the moment, you can get one bone or a couple if you store all the names of a couple if you store all the names of a couple if you store all the names of a bone as strings in an index switch. bone as strings in an index switch. bone as strings in an index switch. Inconvenient. That'll probably be much Inconvenient. That'll probably be much Inconvenient. That'll probably be much more relevant in [music] 5.2. more relevant in [music] 5.2. more relevant in [music] 5.2. If I get the uh armature, no, the If I get the uh armature, no, the If I get the uh armature, no, the attribute the geometry attribute node attribute the geometry attribute node attribute the geometry attribute node in, which shouldn't be too difficult, in, which shouldn't be too difficult, in, which shouldn't be too difficult, but I'm just going to wait until 5.2 is but I'm just going to wait until 5.2 is but I'm just going to wait until 5.2 is actually going. There we go. The string actually going. There we go. The string actually going. There we go. The string to curves has uh uh input sockets. I'm to curves has uh uh input sockets. I'm to curves has uh uh input sockets. I'm hoping to get the word ID in for that, hoping to get the word ID in for that, hoping to get the word ID in for that, which will be good. There's a new font which will be good. There's a new font which will be good. There's a new font socket. Get bundle item, store bundle socket. Get bundle item, store bundle socket. Get bundle item, store bundle item. Uh I'm just making a little note item. Uh I'm just making a little note item. Uh I'm just making a little note for this. I need to fix the bundle for this. I need to fix the bundle for this. I need to fix the bundle signatures in here, which is actually a signatures in here, which is actually a signatures in here, which is actually a bit of a pain because I basically have bit of a pain because I basically have bit of a pain because I basically have to remake the nodes to remake the nodes to remake the nodes uh just to work on like the cuz the uh just to work on like the cuz the uh just to work on like the cuz the signature just stores signature just stores signature just stores it's only on the UI level. I thought it's only on the UI level. I thought it's only on the UI level. I thought when I first made these notes, I thought when I first made these notes, I thought when I first made these notes, I thought it would automatically get what's in the it would automatically get what's in the it would automatically get what's in the bundle, but it doesn't. And it's a bundle, but it doesn't. And it's a bundle, but it doesn't. And it's a little quirky with all that. New matrix little quirky with all that. New matrix little quirky with all that. New matrix SDV node for singular value SDV node for singular value SDV node for singular value decomposition for 3x3 matrices. This is decomposition for 3x3 matrices. This is decomposition for 3x3 matrices. This is very useful for stuff like the rigid very useful for stuff like the rigid very useful for stuff like the rigid body simulation setup for inertia body simulation setup for inertia body simulation setup for inertia tensors, tensors, tensors, which I need to try using that with which I need to try using that with which I need to try using that with that. But there's still the collision that. But there's still the collision that. But there's still the collision points issue. But maybe I'm smart enough points issue. But maybe I'm smart enough points issue. But maybe I'm smart enough to deal with that this time around, even to deal with that this time around, even to deal with that this time around, even if it's for just one collision. Not even if it's for just one collision. Not even if it's for just one collision. Not even tons of them. New uh cube grid topology, tons of them. New uh cube grid topology, tons of them. New uh cube grid topology, which we went over. New grid dilate and which we went over. New grid dilate and which we went over. New grid dilate and a road node. This one, it seems like a a road node. This one, it seems like a a road node. This one, it seems like a specific open VDB thing where it changes specific open VDB thing where it changes specific open VDB thing where it changes the active box and like expands the the active box and like expands the the active box and like expands the bounds. I'm still not all too sure. Uh, bounds. I'm still not all too sure. Uh, bounds. I'm still not all too sure. Uh, the set grid background node has a new the set grid background node has a new the set grid background node has a new option to update the inactive box option to update the inactive box option to update the inactive box values, too. Uh, new grid mean and grid values, too. Uh, new grid mean and grid values, too. Uh, new grid mean and grid media nodes. We'll need to take a look media nodes. We'll need to take a look media nodes. We'll need to take a look at that. So, that's good. That's all for at that. So, that's good. That's all for at that. So, that's good. That's all for geometry nodes, which is amazing. For geometry nodes, which is amazing. For geometry nodes, which is amazing. For the compositor, the mask to SDF node, the compositor, the mask to SDF node, the compositor, the mask to SDF node, I'm very happy about that. That'll be I'm very happy about that. That'll be I'm very happy about that. That'll be very useful for quite few setups. Again, very useful for quite few setups. Again, very useful for quite few setups. Again, I have a vision of being able to have I have a vision of being able to have I have a vision of being able to have little uh compositor nodes and like the little uh compositor nodes and like the little uh compositor nodes and like the shader and geometry node editors because shader and geometry node editors because shader and geometry node editors because it can work on the CPU. it can work on the CPU. it can work on the CPU. So, it'll probably replace the old uh So, it'll probably replace the old uh So, it'll probably replace the old uh disabled the old and unused disabled the old and unused disabled the old and unused um texture editor, but that there has um texture editor, but that there has um texture editor, but that there has been no word on that. That is just a been no word on that. That is just a been no word on that. That is just a vision I have in my brain. I'm not smart vision I have in my brain. I'm not smart vision I have in my brain. I'm not smart enough to even try to implement that, enough to even try to implement that, enough to even try to implement that, but it would be cool. Uh, index switch but it would be cool. Uh, index switch but it would be cool. Uh, index switch is now supported. Sync sequencer strip is now supported. Sync sequencer strip is now supported. Sync sequencer strip info has been added. Uh, I don't believe info has been added. Uh, I don't believe info has been added. Uh, I don't believe this is GPU supported yet, but they plan this is GPU supported yet, but they plan this is GPU supported yet, but they plan for that in 2026, I believe. There's a for that in 2026, I believe. There's a for that in 2026, I believe. There's a whole lot of other changes in there, I whole lot of other changes in there, I whole lot of other changes in there, I think. Um, let's see. I think there's an think. Um, let's see. I think there's an think. Um, let's see. I think there's an option that's coming around where you option that's coming around where you option that's coming around where you can disable the default can disable the default can disable the default uh file output, which is very useful. If uh file output, which is very useful. If uh file output, which is very useful. If you've ever tried to use the uh file you've ever tried to use the uh file you've ever tried to use the uh file output node, it always store it tries to output node, it always store it tries to output node, it always store it tries to output a duplicate, which is annoying output a duplicate, which is annoying output a duplicate, which is annoying when you try to render stuff. I've had when you try to render stuff. I've had when you try to render stuff. I've had to do that in the past. Yeah, there's to do that in the past. Yeah, there's to do that in the past. Yeah, there's all that. Let's see what's up with the all that. Let's see what's up with the all that. Let's see what's up with the Where's the shading. Where's the shading. Where's the shading. Well, let's just go to cycles and see. Well, let's just go to cycles and see. Well, let's just go to cycles and see. Okay. Yep, that seems pretty good. EV Okay. Yep, that seems pretty good. EV Okay. Yep, that seems pretty good. EV and viewport. I'm now expecting planer and viewport. I'm now expecting planer and viewport. I'm now expecting planer reflections now support glossy reflections now support glossy reflections now support glossy reflections and refraction. reflections and refraction. reflections and refraction. Ah, okay, that makes sense. Yep. AOVs Ah, okay, that makes sense. Yep. AOVs Ah, okay, that makes sense. Yep. AOVs have been bumped to 128. That's good. have been bumped to 128. That's good. have been bumped to 128. That's good. Transparency evaluation for shader to Transparency evaluation for shader to Transparency evaluation for shader to RGB. People have been wanting that for a RGB. People have been wanting that for a RGB. People have been wanting that for a long time because they had that in EV long time because they had that in EV long time because they had that in EV legacy and they are porting some of legacy and they are porting some of legacy and they are porting some of those options. HDRI HDRI uh light path those options. HDRI HDRI uh light path those options. HDRI HDRI uh light path node. node. node. I did back support for the light path I did back support for the light path I did back support for the light path node inside the world node tree. Oh, node inside the world node tree. Oh, node inside the world node tree. Oh, another thing for me legacy coming back. another thing for me legacy coming back. another thing for me legacy coming back. It's good to see that. Uh let's see. It's good to see that. Uh let's see. It's good to see that. Uh let's see. overlay to oh the overlay the overlay to oh the overlay the overlay to oh the overlay the performance overlay that is pretty cool. performance overlay that is pretty cool. performance overlay that is pretty cool. Let's take a look at that. Let's take a look at that. Let's take a look at that. Okay. So let's actually take a look at Okay. So let's actually take a look at Okay. So let's actually take a look at the pull request. the pull request. the pull request. So you can see the evaluation So you can see the evaluation So you can see the evaluation synchronization and total times which synchronization and total times which synchronization and total times which let's see I forget which one does which. let's see I forget which one does which. let's see I forget which one does which. I think evaluation is like the CPU side. I think evaluation is like the CPU side. I think evaluation is like the CPU side. The synchronization is like the GPU side The synchronization is like the GPU side The synchronization is like the GPU side but I could be very wrong. But this will but I could be very wrong. But this will but I could be very wrong. But this will be very useful when debugging stuff. be very useful when debugging stuff. be very useful when debugging stuff. So you can see the performance right So you can see the performance right So you can see the performance right there and that will be very very good. there and that will be very very good. there and that will be very very good. Thank you very much to Pulk David for Thank you very much to Pulk David for Thank you very much to Pulk David for that. That will be extremely useful when that. That will be extremely useful when that. That will be extremely useful when debugging why Eevee next is um debugging why Eevee next is um debugging why Eevee next is um slowing down. slowing down. slowing down. Does that um does that work for cycles Does that um does that work for cycles Does that um does that work for cycles too or I assume that's only Eevee. too or I assume that's only Eevee. too or I assume that's only Eevee. Okay. Okay. Even materials are compiled Okay. Okay. Even materials are compiled Okay. Okay. Even materials are compiled by pre Oh, wait. No, this is Yeah, it's by pre Oh, wait. No, this is Yeah, it's by pre Oh, wait. No, this is Yeah, it's for the overlay. Yeah. No, but maybe it for the overlay. Yeah. No, but maybe it for the overlay. Yeah. No, but maybe it works for both. H, I'll need to look works for both. H, I'll need to look works for both. H, I'll need to look into that. into that. into that. Uh, even materials are compiled faster Uh, even materials are compiled faster Uh, even materials are compiled faster by pre-ompiling GPU pipelines at the by pre-ompiling GPU pipelines at the by pre-ompiling GPU pipelines at the same time. GPU shaders compile faster on same time. GPU shaders compile faster on same time. GPU shaders compile faster on all platforms due to pre-processing the all platforms due to pre-processing the all platforms due to pre-processing the shader sources. So, we can see that. shader sources. So, we can see that. shader sources. So, we can see that. See, it goes down. Oh, yeah. No, that's See, it goes down. Oh, yeah. No, that's See, it goes down. Oh, yeah. No, that's actually actually actually it's a little more expensive when it's it's a little more expensive when it's it's a little more expensive when it's warm versus cold warm versus cold warm versus cold then on Vulcan. It's Yeah, just a little then on Vulcan. It's Yeah, just a little then on Vulcan. It's Yeah, just a little more expensive there. But it is much more expensive there.

Are dynamics coming in Pi.1? No. [music] dynamics coming in Pi.1? No. [music] dynamics coming in Pi.1? No. [music] No, they're not. It's It's taking It's No, they're not. It's It's taking It's No, they're not. It's It's taking It's taking a while. See, would it be taking a while. See, would it be taking a while. See, would it be possible to simulate fluids with surface possible to simulate fluids with surface possible to simulate fluids with surface tension in grids, or would you need tension in grids, or would you need tension in grids, or would you need particles for that? Uh, I honestly don't particles for that? Uh, I honestly don't particles for that? Uh, I honestly don't know. I I just don't know, know. I I just don't know, know. I I just don't know, unfortunately. I would assume that it unfortunately. I would assume that it unfortunately. I would assume that it would probably be possible. Maybe not in would probably be possible. Maybe not in would probably be possible. Maybe not in Blender because it well Blender because it well Blender because it well it if it were possible, it would not be it if it were possible, it would not be it if it were possible, it would not be fast at all. fast at all. fast at all. But yeah, But yeah, But yeah, but with the little bit of stuff we but with the little bit of stuff we but with the little bit of stuff we have, it is quite cool. Oh, before if have, it is quite cool. Oh, before if have, it is quite cool. Oh, before if you're wondering about like oh two you're wondering about like oh two you're wondering about like oh two dimensional volumes, the volume cube dimensional volumes, the volume cube dimensional volumes, the volume cube node node node uh this the limit for the resolution was uh this the limit for the resolution was uh this the limit for the resolution was set to two. And now with this we can set set to two. And now with this we can set set to two. And now with this we can set it to one. I assume that's just a it to one. I assume that's just a it to one. I assume that's just a technical limitation. If you try doing technical limitation. If you try doing technical limitation. If you try doing that it's like no the res resolution that it's like no the res resolution that it's like no the res resolution must be greater than one. But now they must be greater than one. But now they must be greater than one. But now they don't have to be greater than one. I don't have to be greater than one. I don't have to be greater than one. I could make this a 1x 256 could make this a 1x 256 could make this a 1x 256 thing. Oh, but of course it doesn't thing. Oh, but of course it doesn't thing. Oh, but of course it doesn't actually show. Yep. Did see something here at the very Did see something here at the very Did see something here at the very least. Let's try 64. Hello. Ah, there we go. Okay. Uh, so it's Yeah. Ah, there we go. Okay. Uh, so it's Yeah. Ah, there we go. Okay. Uh, so it's Yeah. relative or original? Uh, it sets to relative or original? Uh, it sets to relative or original? Uh, it sets to original. So here we should see at least original. So here we should see at least original. So here we should see at least something appearing, right? Let's set that to be 32. There should be Let's set that to be 32. There should be Let's set that to be 32. There should be again something. again something. again something. There isn't. There isn't. There isn't. So many voxels. I actually don't know So many voxels. I actually don't know So many voxels. I actually don't know why that's not working. Let's control Z until we get that back. Let's control Z until we get that back. Let's control Z until we get that back. Maybe it's just the distance is 128. Maybe it's just the distance is 128. Maybe it's just the distance is 128. So that works. Yeah, maybe it's just not So that works. Yeah, maybe it's just not So that works. Yeah, maybe it's just not um that all too well. We go. We can see um that all too well. We go. We can see um that all too well. We go. We can see all that and then that happens which is all that and then that happens which is all that and then that happens which is cool. cool. cool. 256. I tried 512 512 but it is slow as 256. I tried 512 512 but it is slow as 256. I tried 512 512 but it is slow as heck. heck. heck. Yeah. Oh, and I need to adjust the voxil Yeah. Oh, and I need to adjust the voxil Yeah. Oh, and I need to adjust the voxil uh division for some of the parts so uh division for some of the parts so uh division for some of the parts so that does not turn into that. that does not turn into that. that does not turn into that. But yes, But yes, But yes, it's cool. We're getting simulation it's cool. We're getting simulation it's cool. We're getting simulation capabilities. capabilities. capabilities. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. I went to report a bug real bundle and I went to report a bug real bundle and I went to report a bug real bundle and you already had it reported. Uh I did you already had it reported. Uh I did you already had it reported. Uh I did not report a bug, but I made a PR about not report a bug, but I made a PR about not report a bug, but I made a PR about it because I was like, "Oh, shoot. I it because I was like, "Oh, shoot. I it because I was like, "Oh, shoot. I did." Unfortunately, when I made the did." Unfortunately, when I made the did." Unfortunately, when I made the nodes, I did not check to see if the nodes, I did not check to see if the nodes, I did not check to see if the bundle signature was something that was bundle signature was something that was bundle signature was something that was automatically created, and they merged automatically created, and they merged automatically created, and they merged the node before that was put in. Uh, the node before that was put in. Uh, the node before that was put in. Uh, which means that on one hand, it 100% which means that on one hand, it 100% which means that on one hand, it 100% has to be fixed, and it doesn't seem too has to be fixed, and it doesn't seem too has to be fixed, and it doesn't seem too difficult to implement. I just need to difficult to implement. I just need to difficult to implement. I just need to look through and see what functions are look through and see what functions are look through and see what functions are automatically available and if there are automatically available and if there are automatically available and if there are any functions that need to be any functions that need to be any functions that need to be specifically created which I am not specifically created which I am not specifically created which I am not exactly looking forward to. It's exactly looking forward to. It's exactly looking forward to. It's possible. I just need to actually do it. possible. I just need to actually do it. possible. I just need to actually do it. Okay. What are the specific use case use Okay. What are the specific use case use Okay. What are the specific use case use cases you have in mind for lists? I'll cases you have in mind for lists? I'll cases you have in mind for lists? I'll be using it for complex sorting be using it for complex sorting be using it for complex sorting functions. I have a few. I'm glad you functions. I have a few. I'm glad you functions. I have a few. I'm glad you asked. Let's go and get my PRs up. asked. Let's go and get my PRs up. asked. Let's go and get my PRs up. So, So, So, I'm just going to get the PRs. I'm just going to get the PRs. I'm just going to get the PRs. So, let's see. Nameless and collection So, let's see. Nameless and collection So, let's see. Nameless and collection children. So, with this one, I'm just children. So, with this one, I'm just children. So, with this one, I'm just pulling up both of them on my browser. pulling up both of them on my browser. pulling up both of them on my browser. And the data block name, we could And the data block name, we could And the data block name, we could actually take a look at that live today. actually take a look at that live today. actually take a look at that live today. I'm just postponing the actual project I I'm just postponing the actual project I I'm just postponing the actual project I want to do today. And also I'm going to want to do today. And also I'm going to want to do today. And also I'm going to get the uh get the uh get the uh curve to node word ID uh curve to curve to node word ID uh curve to curve to node word ID uh curve to string. There we go. So boop boop boop. string. There we go. So boop boop boop. string. There we go. So boop boop boop. Welcome to another day of news in Welcome to another day of news in Welcome to another day of news in Blender. Blender. Blender. Okay. So let's Okay. So let's Okay. So let's look at this. So the first one uh this look at this. So the first one uh this look at this. So the first one uh this one will probably make it in 5.1. It's one will probably make it in 5.1. It's one will probably make it in 5.1. It's basically just string to curves with basically just string to curves with basically just string to curves with word ID outputs. Uh which is pretty word ID outputs. Uh which is pretty word ID outputs. Uh which is pretty simple. It wasn't too difficult to simple. It wasn't too difficult to simple. It wasn't too difficult to implement. This was discussed in a implement. This was discussed in a implement. This was discussed in a module meeting, so I should um module meeting, so I should um module meeting, so I should um check a few things. Added 31 lines of check a few things. Added 31 lines of check a few things. Added 31 lines of code. I didn't think it Oh, right. No, I code. I didn't think it Oh, right. No, I code. I didn't think it Oh, right. No, I forgot. Yeah, takes a little bit, but forgot. Yeah, takes a little bit, but forgot. Yeah, takes a little bit, but it's not too bad. It's mainly just it's not too bad. It's mainly just it's not too bad. It's mainly just copying what is already existing in copying what is already existing in copying what is already existing in there. But let's take a look at the there. But let's take a look at the there. But let's take a look at the lists. So the two nodes I have in mind lists. So the two nodes I have in mind lists. So the two nodes I have in mind for that use list are the collection for that use list are the collection for that use list are the collection children node which is was inspired by children node which is was inspired by children node which is was inspired by one of Jack's Luke's uh branches where one of Jack's Luke's uh branches where one of Jack's Luke's uh branches where he added an input to the collection info he added an input to the collection info he added an input to the collection info node which had something like this and I node which had something like this and I node which had something like this and I was like oh let me make a node that has was like oh let me make a node that has was like oh let me make a node that has that and the OB or was it the objects or that and the OB or was it the objects or that and the OB or was it the objects or just the collections? Well anyway this just the collections? Well anyway this just the collections? Well anyway this one has both where you can just get all one has both where you can just get all one has both where you can just get all that. Now I could I did not make a build that. Now I could I did not make a build that. Now I could I did not make a build that has this at the moment so I can't that has this at the moment so I can't that has this at the moment so I can't go and show the slide but you would just go and show the slide but you would just go and show the slide but you would just input a collection and it would output input a collection and it would output input a collection and it would output all the objects in that collection and all the objects in that collection and all the objects in that collection and all these subolctions and you can press all these subolctions and you can press all these subolctions and you can press recursive so it will look through all of recursive so it will look through all of recursive so it will look through all of the subolctions. the subolctions. the subolctions. So it's great very very useful when So it's great very very useful when So it's great very very useful when dealing with giant uh I guess guess dealing with giant uh I guess guess dealing with giant uh I guess guess pipeline kind of stuff where you just pipeline kind of stuff where you just pipeline kind of stuff where you just have a collection and then all the have a collection and then all the have a collection and then all the necessary parts in that collection. So necessary parts in that collection. So necessary parts in that collection. So it's very very useful. I wonder if it's very very useful. I wonder if it's very very useful. I wonder if there's going to be a list sort node there's going to be a list sort node there's going to be a list sort node because that [music] would be very good. because that [music] would be very good. because that [music] would be very good. I need to look into that. That that I need to look into that. That that I need to look into that. That that wouldn't be difficult. I don't think wouldn't be difficult. I don't think wouldn't be difficult. I don't think that that wouldn't be too difficult that that wouldn't be too difficult that that wouldn't be too difficult assuming that it's string based. assuming that it's string based. assuming that it's string based. Yeah, I'll need to think about that. But Yeah, I'll need to think about that. But Yeah, I'll need to think about that. But speaking of string lists, uh the speaking of string lists, uh the speaking of string lists, uh the attribute name list node. So at the attribute name list node. So at the attribute name list node. So at the moment, uh the current approach to get moment, uh the current approach to get moment, uh the current approach to get all the attributes is just to do it all the attributes is just to do it all the attributes is just to do it manually, which oh I I did that. manually, which oh I I did that. manually, which oh I I did that. I just X out of Firefox. Yes, I am a I just X out of Firefox. Yes, I am a I just X out of Firefox. Yes, I am a genius. I saw an X button. I was like, genius. I saw an X button. I was like, genius. I saw an X button. I was like, "Oh, I need to go and get that." Sorry, "Oh, I need to go and get that." Sorry, "Oh, I need to go and get that." Sorry, one second everyone. I'm a genius when one second everyone. I'm a genius when one second everyone. I'm a genius when it comes to browsers. Nope, that is the wrong tabs. I'm going Nope, that is the wrong tabs. I'm going Nope, that is the wrong tabs. I'm going to get back up. Ask all your questions to get back up. Ask all your questions to get back up. Ask all your questions now while I am looking through things. now while I am looking through things. now while I am looking through things. Ah, here we go. And we are I'm back. There we go. And we are I'm back. There we go. And we are I'm back. There we go. Attribute name list. where before you Attribute name list. where before you Attribute name list. where before you would have to go and get the just would have to go and get the just would have to go and get the just basically put them in manually which is basically put them in manually which is basically put them in manually which is inconvenient and slow and not very inconvenient and slow and not very inconvenient and slow and not very pipelinable but the proposed solution is pipelinable but the proposed solution is pipelinable but the proposed solution is to get the attribute name lists from to get the attribute name lists from to get the attribute name lists from there and output them there. Now during there and output them there. Now during there and output them there. Now during a module meeting the devs were a module meeting the devs were a module meeting the devs were not entirely sure what would be the best not entirely sure what would be the best not entirely sure what would be the best way to adapt this to use strings the mo way to adapt this to use strings the mo way to adapt this to use strings the mo in the most effective manner. Uh the in the most effective manner. Uh the in the most effective manner. Uh the couple of options that were proposed couple of options that were proposed couple of options that were proposed were to output like the name and then it were to output like the name and then it were to output like the name and then it was another piece of data and then the was another piece of data and then the was another piece of data and then the actual attributes as a bundle list which actual attributes as a bundle list which actual attributes as a bundle list which seems like the most likely solution. So seems like the most likely solution. So seems like the most likely solution. So you would need attribute list and then you would need attribute list and then you would need attribute list and then separate bundle or get bundle item and separate bundle or get bundle item and separate bundle or get bundle item and then separate bundle which is a bit then separate bundle which is a bit then separate bundle which is a bit inconvenient or maybe all the lists inconvenient or maybe all the lists inconvenient or maybe all the lists could just be output there but then you could just be output there but then you could just be output there but then you would need several get list item nodes would need several get list item nodes would need several get list item nodes which is also a little in inconvenient which is also a little in inconvenient which is also a little in inconvenient but the current method that I have here but the current method that I have here but the current method that I have here is just you get the names get list item is just you get the names get list item is just you get the names get list item do that you can get the first UV map or do that you can get the first UV map or do that you can get the first UV map or a armature deform a armature deform a armature deform uh setup though it is much slower than uh setup though it is much slower than uh setup though it is much slower than the default fault I'm assuming just the default fault I'm assuming just the default fault I'm assuming just because of geometry nodes overhead which because of geometry nodes overhead which because of geometry nodes overhead which seems to be fairly significant seems to be fairly significant seems to be fairly significant but yeah and actually storing the but yeah and actually storing the but yeah and actually storing the attributes with stored named attribute attributes with stored named attribute attributes with stored named attribute nodes you probably can't see it all too nodes you probably can't see it all too nodes you probably can't see it all too well and it's not letting me zoom in well and it's not letting me zoom in well and it's not letting me zoom in anymore anymore anymore storing them with stored named attribute storing them with stored named attribute storing them with stored named attribute nodes is faster than just putting them nodes is faster than just putting them nodes is faster than just putting them through a repeat zone without the through a repeat zone without the through a repeat zone without the geometry which is weird but oh well geometry which is weird but oh well geometry which is weird but oh well uh and then with all that yeah that uh and then with all that yeah that uh and then with all that yeah that that's everything there. Someone put a that's everything there. Someone put a that's everything there. Someone put a frowny face on there. H. frowny face on there. H. frowny face on there. H. And then, yeah, there's just a lot of um And then, yeah, there's just a lot of um And then, yeah, there's just a lot of um options there. Uh I'm also thinking options there. Uh I'm also thinking options there. Uh I'm also thinking about putting in a the last thing I did about putting in a the last thing I did about putting in a the last thing I did was put in a boolean input for filtering was put in a boolean input for filtering was put in a boolean input for filtering or not filtering, but I have not figured or not filtering, but I have not figured or not filtering, but I have not figured out how to make it hide the menus in out how to make it hide the menus in out how to make it hide the menus in there, which I know is possible. there, which I know is possible. there, which I know is possible. But yeah, that is the stuff. There will But yeah, that is the stuff. There will But yeah, that is the stuff. There will be a list uh sort node. Uh I've seen it be a list uh sort node. Uh I've seen it be a list uh sort node. Uh I've seen it in an included PR. Ah that's good. That in an included PR. Ah that's good. That in an included PR. Ah that's good. That is good. Sorting the list and then like is good. Sorting the list and then like is good. Sorting the list and then like filtering lists. That will be very very filtering lists. That will be very very filtering lists. That will be very very useful. But yeah, that is that those are useful. But yeah, that is that those are useful. But yeah, that is that those are my plans my plans my plans and it will be good. It's just those and it will be good. It's just those and it will be good. It's just those will not be in 5.1. Those will be in 5.2 will not be in 5.1. Those will be in 5.2 will not be in 5.1. Those will be in 5.2 because lists will not be in 5.1. because lists will not be in 5.1. because lists will not be in 5.1. did not know that until uh did not know that until uh did not know that until uh later last week. later last week. later last week. But yes, now that we're back in the But yes, now that we're back in the But yes, now that we're back in the Blender scene, I'm going to go and make Blender scene, I'm going to go and make Blender scene, I'm going to go and make a new scene because I want to just go a new scene because I want to just go a new scene because I want to just go and try a new little project. and try a new little project. and try a new little project. So, let's see. Let's go into here. I'm So, let's see. Let's go into here. I'm So, let's see. Let's go into here. I'm going to be using uh GPU displacement going to be using uh GPU displacement going to be using uh GPU displacement and it will be fun. So, a while back, and it will be fun. So, a while back, and it will be fun. So, a while back, uh, a buddy of mine was playing uh, a buddy of mine was playing uh, a buddy of mine was playing Cyberpunk and there was a cool like Cyberpunk and there was a cool like Cyberpunk and there was a cool like digital world scene and where everything digital world scene and where everything digital world scene and where everything was like box that like stretched and was like box that like stretched and was like box that like stretched and went down into the scene. You You'll went down into the scene. You You'll went down into the scene. You You'll know it when I actually make it because know it when I actually make it because know it when I actually make it because it is not difficult to make whatsoever. it is not difficult to make whatsoever. it is not difficult to make whatsoever. I want to attempt making it and then I I want to attempt making it and then I I want to attempt making it and then I can make it look all nice and pretty. can make it look all nice and pretty. can make it look all nice and pretty. Something like that. I'm just going to Something like that. I'm just going to Something like that. I'm just going to go to geo nodes, new. I'm going to go to geo nodes, new. I'm going to go to geo nodes, new. I'm going to distribute points on faces. distribute points on faces. distribute points on faces. distribute points on faces, instance on distribute points on faces, instance on distribute points on faces, instance on points points points and then I will realize the instances. and then I will realize the instances. and then I will realize the instances. So just like this, I'm just going to So just like this, I'm just going to So just like this, I'm just going to make a cool little project make a cool little project make a cool little project because I'm just uh going quickly. Oh. because I'm just uh going quickly. Oh. because I'm just uh going quickly. Oh. Oh, it automatically sets an ID now. Oh, it automatically sets an ID now. Oh, it automatically sets an ID now. I did not know that. I did not know that. I did not know that. Nice. Oh, that is that is great. Or Nice. Oh, that is that is great. Or Nice. Oh, that is that is great.

I don't remember seeing the um the IDs for don't remember seeing the um the IDs for don't remember seeing the um the IDs for that. That is really really really that. That is really really really that. That is really really really really good. really good. really good. Oh, you love to see it. Uh okay. So now Oh, you love to see it. Uh okay. So now Oh, you love to see it. Uh okay. So now I'm going to make a plane. I'm not sure I'm going to make a plane. I'm not sure I'm going to make a plane. I'm not sure if I want to rotate this [music] towards if I want to rotate this [music] towards if I want to rotate this [music] towards the camera or not or make it a the camera or not or make it a the camera or not or make it a crisscross pattern. Not sure. I just crisscross pattern. Not sure. I just crisscross pattern. Not sure. I just want it to be as fast as possible. want it to be as fast as possible. want it to be as fast as possible. Which you may be wondering, wait, why Which you may be wondering, wait, why Which you may be wondering, wait, why are you realizing the instances if you are you realizing the instances if you are you realizing the instances if you want it to be as fast as possible? Well, want it to be as fast as possible? Well, want it to be as fast as possible? Well, that's because um that's because um that's because um realizing instances re uh renders realizing instances re uh renders realizing instances re uh renders everything faster than if I were not to everything faster than if I were not to everything faster than if I were not to do that. So, here I'm going to do this. do that. So, here I'm going to do this. do that. So, here I'm going to do this. I'm going to change the world to be I'm going to change the world to be I'm going to change the world to be completely black. I'm going to change completely black. I'm going to change completely black. I'm going to change the color management to be aces 1.3. the color management to be aces 1.3. the color management to be aces 1.3. Even though 2.0 might be a bit better. I Even though 2.0 might be a bit better. I Even though 2.0 might be a bit better. I probably should just use 2.0, but h 1.3. probably should just use 2.0, but h 1.3. probably should just use 2.0, but h 1.3. Yeah. Uh we'll do emission and Yeah. Uh we'll do emission and Yeah. Uh we'll do emission and transparent. And then we don't need to transparent. And then we don't need to transparent. And then we don't need to worry about the displacement. The worry about the displacement. The worry about the displacement. The displacement will just be let me go and displacement will just be let me go and displacement will just be let me go and move that over to there. I always use move that over to there. I always use move that over to there. I always use the geonode uh workspace because it is the geonode uh workspace because it is the geonode uh workspace because it is just the best out of the bunch. The just the best out of the bunch. The just the best out of the bunch. The shader editor boots up Eevee shader editor boots up Eevee shader editor boots up Eevee automatically which is not good automatically which is not good automatically which is not good uh for speed. And this one also includes uh for speed. And this one also includes uh for speed. And this one also includes the timeline which the shader editor the timeline which the shader editor the timeline which the shader editor does. Uh the shader workspace does not. does. Uh the shader workspace does not. does. Uh the shader workspace does not. We have this. We're going to do that. We have this. We're going to do that. We have this. We're going to do that. We're going to do this. And I think for We're going to do this. And I think for We're going to do this. And I think for the moment I'm just going to make this the moment I'm just going to make this the moment I'm just going to make this kind of blue. Change this to be blended. kind of blue. Change this to be blended. kind of blue. Change this to be blended. And since these are all in one level, we And since these are all in one level, we And since these are all in one level, we don't need to worry about it lagging, I don't need to worry about it lagging, I don't need to worry about it lagging, I think, because it didn't initiate a ton think, because it didn't initiate a ton think, because it didn't initiate a ton of draw calls, I think, in order to do of draw calls, I think, in order to do of draw calls, I think, in order to do that. But the real cool stuff is I'll be that. But the real cool stuff is I'll be that. But the real cool stuff is I'll be using the UV map using the UV map using the UV map to drive the displacement based on to drive the displacement based on to drive the displacement based on distance. So, if I go and get the object distance. So, if I go and get the object distance. So, if I go and get the object position, object info location, and then position, object info location, and then position, object info location, and then get the length and [music] then add to get the length and [music] then add to get the length and [music] then add to that length, then use a map range. that length, then use a map range. that length, then use a map range. Uh, here we go. Map range. Uh, here we go. Map range. Uh, here we go. Map range. We go smoother step vector math We go smoother step vector math We go smoother step vector math multiply. There we go. Let's set that to multiply. There we go. Let's set that to multiply. There we go. Let's set that to be 10. And I hook that into the be 10. And I hook that into the be 10. And I hook that into the displacement kind of like geometry displacement kind of like geometry displacement kind of like geometry nodes. We can see that all these parts. Oh, right. because the location is not Oh, right. because the location is not Oh, right. because the location is not actually stored there. I need to store actually stored there. I need to store actually stored there. I need to store the location of the points the location of the points the location of the points just so that there's no weird like just so that there's no weird like just so that there's no weird like interpolation. So, vector uh position interpolation. So, vector uh position interpolation. So, vector uh position just put that in there. Position just put that in there. Position just put that in there. Position on buddy. on buddy. on buddy. Go shader editor. Go back to the main Go shader editor. Go back to the main Go shader editor. Go back to the main thing. Oh, right. The plane. thing. Oh, right. The plane. thing. Oh, right. The plane. Uh, okay. So, we have all that. Let's go Uh, okay. So, we have all that. Let's go Uh, okay. So, we have all that. Let's go and get the attributes. And it does not and get the attributes. And it does not and get the attributes. And it does not need to be on the instancer need to be on the instancer need to be on the instancer uh domain because everything is realized uh domain because everything is realized uh domain because everything is realized which if you wanted it so that worked on which if you wanted it so that worked on which if you wanted it so that worked on both levels you can just go into both levels you can just go into both levels you can just go into instancer or that and then add the two instancer or that and then add the two instancer or that and then add the two and it'll add whichever one is currently and it'll add whichever one is currently and it'll add whichever one is currently available. But here if we take a look at available. But here if we take a look at available. But here if we take a look at this we can see this we can see this we can see but it doesn't look like the way it but it doesn't look like the way it but it doesn't look like the way it should. So we can use the UV map to should. So we can use the UV map to should. So we can use the UV map to offset the quote unquote time of the offset the quote unquote time of the offset the quote unquote time of the effect. So here we can just use multiply effect. So here we can just use multiply effect. So here we can just use multiply put that into there and that is the put that into there and that is the put that into there and that is the incorrect one. Uh there we go. So we set incorrect one. Uh there we go. So we set incorrect one. Uh there we go. So we set that to be 0.5 and then that to be 0.5 and then that to be 0.5 and then Yep. That's like that. And I just need Yep. That's like that. And I just need Yep. That's like that. And I just need to do I divide before or after? I think to do I divide before or after? I think to do I divide before or after? I think before would be better. Set that to be before would be better. Set that to be before would be better. Set that to be like five. There we go. So like So like five. There we go. So like So like five. There we go. So like So we can see that that's pretty fast we can see that that's pretty fast we can see that that's pretty fast because it's all GPU displacement because it's all GPU displacement because it's all GPU displacement without a ton of draw calls. That is without a ton of draw calls. That is without a ton of draw calls. That is pretty pretty cool. Pretty good. Now I pretty pretty cool. Pretty good. Now I pretty pretty cool. Pretty good. Now I just need to make it look even better. just need to make it look even better. just need to make it look even better. So we do that. We do that. Put that over So we do that. We do that. Put that over So we do that. We do that. Put that over to there. Um to there. Um to there. Um over to there. Put it over to there. over to there. Put it over to there. over to there. Put it over to there. Bring this over to here. Bring this over to here. Bring this over to here. Uh, okay. Now, let's go and get the UV Uh, okay. Now, let's go and get the UV Uh, okay. Now, let's go and get the UV map and make this actually look good. map and make this actually look good. map and make this actually look good. So, we can get the length. So, we can get the length. So, we can get the length. Put that through a map range. Let me Put that through a map range. Let me Put that through a map range. Let me just control V. Oh, you can also copy just control V. Oh, you can also copy just control V. Oh, you can also copy nodes between Blender instances now in nodes between Blender instances now in nodes between Blender instances now in 5.1, which is so great. That's going to 5.1, which is so great. That's going to 5.1, which is so great. That's going to make things so much better for everyone. make things so much better for everyone. make things so much better for everyone. Uh, let's go and use the LG lightfall Uh, let's go and use the LG lightfall Uh, let's go and use the LG lightfall thing, which has carried my entire thing, which has carried my entire thing, which has carried my entire career, and I don't know why it works at career, and I don't know why it works at career, and I don't know why it works at this point. I don't know why I made it this point. I don't know why I made it this point. I don't know why I made it like this, but it just works and I don't like this, but it just works and I don't like this, but it just works and I don't question it. question it. question it. And that And that And that uh distance uh distance uh distance 0.5 just so that we get the middle and 0.5 just so that we get the middle and 0.5 just so that we get the middle and then we just need to multiply you so then we just need to multiply you so then we just need to multiply you so that ah there we go. I just need to add that ah there we go. I just need to add that ah there we go. I just need to add in some bloom and then we're going to in some bloom and then we're going to in some bloom and then we're going to get the coolest looking thing on the get the coolest looking thing on the get the coolest looking thing on the planets. And maybe I should add in some planets. And maybe I should add in some planets. And maybe I should add in some general variation general variation general variation for the stuff. But just look at that. for the stuff. But just look at that. for the stuff. But just look at that. Then I need to make the gradient um Then I need to make the gradient um Then I need to make the gradient um disappear when it gets to the top, which disappear when it gets to the top, which disappear when it gets to the top, which is pretty easy. I just need to use a map is pretty easy. I just need to use a map is pretty easy. I just need to use a map range again. range again. range again. Put that into there. And then we just Put that into there. And then we just Put that into there. And then we just use mix or multiply. I'll I'll just do a use mix or multiply. I'll I'll just do a use mix or multiply. I'll I'll just do a mix so that I don't need to worry about mix so that I don't need to worry about mix so that I don't need to worry about it. it. it. Go at the top. Yes, we can see. Even Go at the top. Yes, we can see. Even Go at the top. Yes, we can see. Even though maybe that should be like 0.5 though maybe that should be like 0.5 though maybe that should be like 0.5 and 75. There we go. Then maybe 0.25. and 75. There we go. Then maybe 0.25. and 75. There we go. Then maybe 0.25. There we go. That's better. So it's like and I should probably store a random and I should probably store a random and I should probably store a random value for each island so that I can add value for each island so that I can add value for each island so that I can add in some randomness in some randomness in some randomness and maybe also make it so that this is and maybe also make it so that this is and maybe also make it so that this is the plane is a crisscross so that it the plane is a crisscross so that it the plane is a crisscross so that it doesn't look weird from other angles. doesn't look weird from other angles. doesn't look weird from other angles. Yeah, there we go. So now it's just a Yeah, there we go. So now it's just a Yeah, there we go. So now it's just a little bit better. So once I get the little bit better. So once I get the little bit better. So once I get the random data stored on there and it's all random data stored on there and it's all random data stored on there and it's all just cached so it doesn't need to update just cached so it doesn't need to update just cached so it doesn't need to update automatically automatically automatically right here. We do that make it a flow right here. We do that make it a flow right here. We do that make it a flow and make this random. and make this random. and make this random. Add in a random value right there. We Add in a random value right there. We Add in a random value right there. We put this there. We move this up to put this there. We move this up to put this there. We move this up to there. We look in the shader editor. there. We look in the shader editor. there. We look in the shader editor. Go. We go to the plane again. I should Go. We go to the plane again. I should Go. We go to the plane again. I should just have the as well so that I don't just have the as well so that I don't just have the as well so that I don't need to look through both need to look through both need to look through both both. So, let's do this just to make both. So, let's do this just to make both. So, let's do this just to make this a little bit easier to work this a little bit easier to work this a little bit easier to work through. I find that I'm liking the kind through. I find that I'm liking the kind through. I find that I'm liking the kind of vertical stack method of organizing of vertical stack method of organizing of vertical stack method of organizing nodes. nodes. nodes. Not entirely sure why cuz it can look a Not entirely sure why cuz it can look a Not entirely sure why cuz it can look a little bit messy. little bit messy. little bit messy. Seems to work. So, random. We need to Seems to work. So, random. We need to Seems to work. So, random. We need to subtract 0.5 before we multiply just to subtract 0.5 before we multiply just to subtract 0.5 before we multiply just to make it so that it's not normalized or make it so that it's not normalized or make it so that it's not normalized or it goes in the positive and negative it goes in the positive and negative it goes in the positive and negative directions. directions. directions. Right there. Make this another little Right there. Make this another little Right there. Make this another little vertical stack. And then we plug it into vertical stack. And then we plug it into vertical stack. And then we plug it into there. So one operation per kind of there. So one operation per kind of there. So one operation per kind of back. Do that. Place that in there. We back. Do that. Place that in there. We back. Do that. Place that in there. We can put that in there as well, which is can put that in there as well, which is can put that in there as well, which is very nice. And then for the origin part very nice. And then for the origin part very nice. And then for the origin part here, we can just go and collapse some here, we can just go and collapse some here, we can just go and collapse some of these nodes and do that, which is of these nodes and do that, which is of these nodes and do that, which is nice. Here we can see there's a bit of nice. Here we can see there's a bit of nice. Here we can see there's a bit of randomness. And we can make that a lot randomness. And we can make that a lot randomness. And we can make that a lot more or a lot less. So I think two is more or a lot less. So I think two is more or a lot less. So I think two is fine. fine. fine. I think that's fine. Let's go in the I think that's fine. Let's go in the I think that's fine. Let's go in the compositing and add in a little bit. Oh, compositing and add in a little bit. Oh, compositing and add in a little bit. Oh, the compositor tab changed. We're here. the compositor tab changed. We're here. the compositor tab changed. We're here. Uh, it doesn't show there, but it shows Uh, it doesn't show there, but it shows Uh, it doesn't show there, but it shows up there, which actually I don't mind. I up there, which actually I don't mind. I up there, which actually I don't mind. I don't mind at all. Uh, let's go. I'm don't mind at all. Uh, let's go. I'm don't mind at all. Uh, let's go. I'm actually going to save this. One second, actually going to save this. One second, actually going to save this. One second, everyone. everyone. everyone. Cuz I forgot to save file. Save. I had a crash when I tried file. Save. I had a crash when I tried file. Save. I had a crash when I tried to render or do compositing without an to render or do compositing without an to render or do compositing without an actual rendered image. So I'm just being actual rendered image. So I'm just being actual rendered image. So I'm just being a little cautious. So this will be uh a little cautious. So this will be uh a little cautious. So this will be uh net shader or something like that. Let's net shader or something like that. Let's net shader or something like that. Let's go render one thing. Let's take a look. go render one thing. Let's take a look. go render one thing. Let's take a look. Okay. So that's like that. So the new uh Okay. So that's like that. So the new uh Okay. So that's like that. So the new uh compositor editor which I think looks compositor editor which I think looks compositor editor which I think looks pretty cool. Let's go back into here. pretty cool. Let's go back into here. pretty cool. Let's go back into here. Have this in the viewport always. And Have this in the viewport always. And Have this in the viewport always. And that is looking pretty cool. Very very that is looking pretty cool. Very very that is looking pretty cool. Very very cool. cool. cool. All right. So with that we can go and All right. So with that we can go and All right. So with that we can go and change this to whatever color we want. change this to whatever color we want. change this to whatever color we want. Oh, that is that's looking quite cool. I Oh, that is that's looking quite cool. I Oh, that is that's looking quite cool. I can uh basically do whatever. can uh basically do whatever. can uh basically do whatever. Oh, also one thing that I was like I Oh, also one thing that I was like I Oh, also one thing that I was like I should try adding this to the shader should try adding this to the shader should try adding this to the shader editor cuz constants I think are allowed editor cuz constants I think are allowed editor cuz constants I think are allowed now. I actually need to ask about that, now. I actually need to ask about that, now. I actually need to ask about that, but there's no shots making it to 5.1. but there's no shots making it to 5.1. but there's no shots making it to 5.1. The scene time node, I really want that The scene time node, I really want that The scene time node, I really want that in the shader editor. in the shader editor. in the shader editor. I do not know how to do it, but I really I do not know how to do it, but I really I do not know how to do it, but I really want to try. But there there's no shot want to try. But there there's no shot want to try. But there there's no shot of that making it into 5.1. I thought I of that making it into 5.1. I thought I of that making it into 5.1. I thought I had more time. It's the the deadline is had more time. It's the the deadline is had more time. It's the the deadline is this week or wait, no, next week. Today, this week or wait, no, next week. Today, this week or wait, no, next week. Today, Saturday. Saturday. Saturday. But yeah, I really uh But yeah, I really uh But yeah, I really uh 5.2 5.2. If I want to get one thing in 5.2 5.2. If I want to get one thing in 5.2 5.2. If I want to get one thing in there, it will be the scene time node. there, it will be the scene time node. there, it will be the scene time node. No matter what I have to do No matter what I have to do No matter what I have to do that and the texture socket. Well, Jax that and the texture socket. Well, Jax that and the texture socket. Well, Jax is already working on that. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, yep, we have all that. And then I So, yep, we have all that. And then I So, yep, we have all that. And then I need to add in a little bit of ambient need to add in a little bit of ambient need to add in a little bit of ambient animation for when these are on the animation for when these are on the animation for when these are on the ground. ground. ground. So, that's just the general So, that's just the general So, that's just the general displacement. And I could add in another And I could add in another And I could add in another put this over to here cuz this is the put this over to here cuz this is the put this over to here cuz this is the actual. See, you can use hashtag frame instead See, you can use hashtag frame instead See, you can use hashtag frame instead of key framing or the same time node. I of key framing or the same time node. I of key framing or the same time node. I know about hashtag frame, but as mod has know about hashtag frame, but as mod has know about hashtag frame, but as mod has said right there, said right there, said right there, hashtag frame, everyone uses it because hashtag frame, everyone uses it because hashtag frame, everyone uses it because it's the most convenient, but you it's the most convenient, but you it's the most convenient, but you shouldn't because well, I'm not going to shouldn't because well, I'm not going to shouldn't because well, I'm not going to say you shouldn't because it's basically say you shouldn't because it's basically say you shouldn't because it's basically the only good convenient way of doing the only good convenient way of doing the only good convenient way of doing it. it. it. The attribute methods like using uh the The attribute methods like using uh the The attribute methods like using uh the attribute node, it doesn't work in attribute node, it doesn't work in attribute node, it doesn't work in cycles. Sometimes I've tried where it's cycles. Sometimes I've tried where it's cycles. Sometimes I've tried where it's like view layer and then you get d like view layer and then you get d like view layer and then you get d something something something something something something and sometimes it doesn't update because and sometimes it doesn't update because and sometimes it doesn't update because of dependency graph stuff. Maybe they of dependency graph stuff. Maybe they of dependency graph stuff. Maybe they fixed it. But a scene time node would be fixed it. But a scene time node would be fixed it. But a scene time node would be the only it would be the solution. the only it would be the solution. the only it would be the solution. Hashtag frame is the only way people Hashtag frame is the only way people Hashtag frame is the only way people actually do it these days. But it's not actually do it these days. But it's not actually do it these days. But it's not the best. Scene time node is very the best. Scene time node is very the best. Scene time node is very necessary, but it's uh necessary, but it's uh necessary, but it's uh the shader editor needs a a bit of work the shader editor needs a a bit of work the shader editor needs a a bit of work before it's implemented, but it's a very before it's implemented, but it's a very before it's implemented, but it's a very it needs to be in sync with every other it needs to be in sync with every other it needs to be in sync with every other editor in Blender. Now, the compositor editor in Blender. Now, the compositor editor in Blender. Now, the compositor has it because it's just easier to has it because it's just easier to has it because it's just easier to implement it there. implement it there. implement it there. It's has it for has had it for years at It's has it for has had it for years at It's has it for has had it for years at this point. I think multiple years this point. I think multiple years this point. I think multiple years actually. I could check that right now. actually. I could check that right now. actually. I could check that right now. Just got to get VS Code up on the side Just got to get VS Code up on the side Just got to get VS Code up on the side and then I'll be able to see Windows Windows Windows is lagging. is lagging. is lagging. It's not allowing me to search. Windows 11 is being uh kind of weird. Windows 11 is being uh kind of weird. Windows 11 is being uh kind of weird. But long story short, um, #frame, it But long story short, um, #frame, it But long story short, um, #frame, it it's about time we abandoned the weird it's about time we abandoned the weird it's about time we abandoned the weird driver method because it's just slow. driver method because it's just slow. driver method because it's just slow. Uh, okay. What did I want to do? I Uh, okay. What did I want to do? I Uh, okay. What did I want to do? I wanted to change the lighting here, wanted to change the lighting here, wanted to change the lighting here, which Oh, that actually that works very which Oh, that actually that works very which Oh, that actually that works very well for well for well for bit of randomness. bit of randomness. bit of randomness. Pretty cool. Pretty nice. Pretty cool. Pretty nice. Pretty cool. Pretty nice. Then let me just go and animate this Then let me just go and animate this Then let me just go and animate this from start to finish. Actually, from start to finish. Actually, from start to finish. Actually, best way to do it is to just have a best way to do it is to just have a best way to do it is to just have a value that goes from zero to one and value that goes from zero to one and value that goes from zero to one and then you map range it after just so that then you map range it after just so that then you map range it after just so that you don't need to keep changing the you don't need to keep changing the you don't need to keep changing the actual animated values all the time. actual animated values all the time. actual animated values all the time. I'll switch that to be a subtract node. I'll switch that to be a subtract node. I'll switch that to be a subtract node. So the start needs to be something like So the start needs to be something like So the start needs to be something like that and the end. that and the end. that and the end. Change this to linear as well. I love Change this to linear as well. I love Change this to linear as well. I love the colors in there. the colors in there. the colors in there. Uh, and then that has to be like that. Uh, and then that has to be like that. Uh, and then that has to be like that. So with that, we can see turn off So with that, we can see turn off So with that, we can see turn off temporal reprojection. Always turn that temporal reprojection. Always turn that temporal reprojection. Always turn that off. Always turn that off. I I've I've know I' I know I've been a I I've I've know I' I know I've been a I I've I've know I' I know I've been a critic about Eevee next, but I've I've critic about Eevee next, but I've I've critic about Eevee next, but I've I've started to learn a bit more about it. started to learn a bit more about it. started to learn a bit more about it. And if you have denoising off, it's And if you have denoising off, it's And if you have denoising off, it's actually not that bad. Like if you have actually not that bad. Like if you have actually not that bad. Like if you have den noising off, precision one, den noising off, precision one, den noising off, precision one, thickness set to two, resolution set to thickness set to two, resolution set to thickness set to two, resolution set to one of one, which is the only way you one of one, which is the only way you one of one, which is the only way you can actually render things well without can actually render things well without can actually render things well without having denoising on. having denoising on. having denoising on. And then fasti approximation, you could And then fasti approximation, you could And then fasti approximation, you could keep that on or off. Just make sure it's keep that on or off. Just make sure it's keep that on or off. Just make sure it's like 0.5, but turning it off can help in like 0.5, but turning it off can help in like 0.5, but turning it off can help in some situations. With the shadows, keep some situations. With the shadows, keep some situations. With the shadows, keep the res resolution at 0.25 so that it the res resolution at 0.25 so that it the res resolution at 0.25 so that it doesn't lag your machine to hell. And doesn't lag your machine to hell. And doesn't lag your machine to hell. And then uh with the shadows changing this then uh with the shadows changing this then uh with the shadows changing this doesn't really affect too much besides doesn't really affect too much besides doesn't really affect too much besides again the resolution light threshold again the resolution light threshold again the resolution light threshold that's all fine for the render samples that's all fine for the render samples that's all fine for the render samples if you don't have ray tracing on 64 is if you don't have ray tracing on 64 is if you don't have ray tracing on 64 is like the minimum to get an okay result. like the minimum to get an okay result. like the minimum to get an okay result. So basically with EV next my opinion on So basically with EV next my opinion on So basically with EV next my opinion on it. This is just my opinion. If they fix it. This is just my opinion. If they fix it. This is just my opinion. If they fix the deninoiser and make it so that it's the deninoiser and make it so that it's the deninoiser and make it so that it's not a not a not a um [clears throat] um [clears throat] um [clears throat] noisy a blurred noisy muddy result. noisy a blurred noisy muddy result. noisy a blurred noisy muddy result. It would be a lot it would be pretty It would be a lot it would be pretty It would be a lot it would be pretty good. Bounce lighting is quite nice good. Bounce lighting is quite nice good. Bounce lighting is quite nice but yeah but yeah but yeah I sometimes ruins the render. Uh yeah. I sometimes ruins the render. Uh yeah. I sometimes ruins the render. Uh yeah. So when in doubt, just disable So when in doubt, just disable So when in doubt, just disable everything. All the fast things because everything. All the fast things because everything. All the fast things because it it it compromises the quality a the it it it compromises the quality a the it it it compromises the quality a the denoising denoising denoising really compromises reflections really compromises reflections really compromises reflections horrifically, especially if you're using horrifically, especially if you're using horrifically, especially if you're using metals. So never have bilateral filter metals. So never have bilateral filter metals. So never have bilateral filter on. Temporal accumulation, try to have on. Temporal accumulation, try to have on. Temporal accumulation, try to have that off all the time. Spatial reuse, that off all the time. Spatial reuse, that off all the time. Spatial reuse, turn it off if you feel like you can get turn it off if you feel like you can get turn it off if you feel like you can get away with it in your scene. Even though away with it in your scene. Even though away with it in your scene. Even though spatial reuse is like the least bad spatial reuse is like the least bad spatial reuse is like the least bad option out of the bunch, just never option out of the bunch, just never option out of the bunch, just never usually don't have these two on if you usually don't have these two on if you usually don't have these two on if you want a not super blurry result. want a not super blurry result. want a not super blurry result. Yeah. And it doesn't look smooth. It Yeah. And it doesn't look smooth. It Yeah. And it doesn't look smooth. It looks muddy because it's just blurring looks muddy because it's just blurring looks muddy because it's just blurring the noise in a weird way. But with that the noise in a weird way. But with that the noise in a weird way. But with that out of the way, and then the shadows are out of the way, and then the shadows are out of the way, and then the shadows are very expensive in EV Next. Just keep the very expensive in EV Next. Just keep the very expensive in EV Next. Just keep the resolution at 0.25. it doesn't change resolution at 0.25. it doesn't change resolution at 0.25. it doesn't change the visual result all too much if you're the visual result all too much if you're the visual result all too much if you're using somewhat soft shadows. using somewhat soft shadows. using somewhat soft shadows. So basically there's a way to make it So basically there's a way to make it So basically there's a way to make it work. And also for each light in the work. And also for each light in the work. And also for each light in the scene make sure you turn on jittered scene make sure you turn on jittered scene make sure you turn on jittered shadows because they are more accurate. shadows because they are more accurate. shadows because they are more accurate. The other the default leads to lots of The other the default leads to lots of The other the default leads to lots of light leaking though it does hurt the light leaking though it does hurt the light leaking though it does hurt the res the render time by about 35%. res the render time by about 35%. res the render time by about 35%. So yeah, be honest, I was disappointed So yeah, be honest, I was disappointed So yeah, be honest, I was disappointed when the devs revealed ray tracing was when the devs revealed ray tracing was when the devs revealed ray tracing was going to be screen spaced. They plan on going to be screen spaced. They plan on going to be screen spaced. They plan on making it so that it will not be screen making it so that it will not be screen making it so that it will not be screen space, but with how expensive screen space, but with how expensive screen space, but with how expensive screen space uh rays are, I think there would space uh rays are, I think there would space uh rays are, I think there would be need to be a massive speed up before be need to be a massive speed up before be need to be a massive speed up before ray tracing would be anywhere close to ray tracing would be anywhere close to ray tracing would be anywhere close to computationally viable compared to computationally viable compared to computationally viable compared to cycles. cycles. cycles. It's uh it's a bit rough on the speed It's uh it's a bit rough on the speed It's uh it's a bit rough on the speed side. side. side. Yeah, that that's another Yeah, that that's another Yeah, that that's another another episode in my critiques of EV another episode in my critiques of EV another episode in my critiques of EV Next cuz it it has Next cuz it it has Next cuz it it has it has been a bit rough in my attempts it has been a bit rough in my attempts it has been a bit rough in my attempts at using it in personal and professional at using it in personal and professional at using it in personal and professional projects. projects. projects. It's been rough. It's been rough. It's been rough. But anyway, I do like the displacement, But anyway, I do like the displacement, But anyway, I do like the displacement, though. Keep in mind that displacement though. Keep in mind that displacement though. Keep in mind that displacement only is not an option in EV next. That's only is not an option in EV next. That's only is not an option in EV next. That's only available in cycles. Even though I only available in cycles. Even though I only available in cycles. Even though I wish it was an option. I hope that's wish it was an option. I hope that's wish it was an option. I hope that's implemented one day. One day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that out of the way, let's go and But that out of the way, let's go and But that out of the way, let's go and add in some displacement to these points add in some displacement to these points add in some displacement to these points here. Cuz right now with this here. Cuz right now with this here. Cuz right now with this displacement, this is com this is not displacement, this is com this is not displacement, this is com this is not viable whatsoever for viable whatsoever for viable whatsoever for objects that are not emissive. because objects that are not emissive. because objects that are not emissive. because with displacement and bump, it'll go and with displacement and bump, it'll go and with displacement and bump, it'll go and make everything look weird if these were make everything look weird if these were make everything look weird if these were solid. If it were dis displacement only, solid. If it were dis displacement only, solid. If it were dis displacement only, it wouldn't be a problem. But we just it wouldn't be a problem. But we just it wouldn't be a problem. But we just don't have that ability at the moment. don't have that ability at the moment. don't have that ability at the moment. Uh, okay. Let's go. What was I going to Uh, okay. Let's go. What was I going to Uh, okay. Let's go. What was I going to Let's just have this here. Or no, let's Let's just have this here. Or no, let's Let's just have this here. Or no, let's make this one dimension to make this as make this one dimension to make this as make this one dimension to make this as fast as possible. Bring this the random fast as possible. Bring this the random fast as possible. Bring this the random into there. I should multiply this by a into there. I should multiply this by a into there. I should multiply this by a lot. or maybe even white noise it, but lot. or maybe even white noise it, but lot. or maybe even white noise it, but that might not be the best idea that might not be the best idea that might not be the best idea by 10. Right here, we can go and turn by 10. Right here, we can go and turn by 10. Right here, we can go and turn off normalize and then add that to our off normalize and then add that to our off normalize and then add that to our displacement right here. displacement right here. displacement right here. Add plug that into there. Plug that into Add plug that into there. Plug that into Add plug that into there. Plug that into there. I should go and scale the output there. I should go and scale the output there. I should go and scale the output there. We should use the scene time there. We should use the scene time there. We should use the scene time node. Oh, wait. That doesn't exist. Use node. Oh, wait. That doesn't exist. Use node. Oh, wait. That doesn't exist. Use hashtag frame because that is the only hashtag frame because that is the only hashtag frame because that is the only convenience thing here. I apologize mod. convenience thing here. I apologize mod. convenience thing here. I apologize mod. I do not remember the recommended way of I do not remember the recommended way of I do not remember the recommended way of actually doing it using the attribute actually doing it using the attribute actually doing it using the attribute inputs, but they also they do not work inputs, but they also they do not work inputs, but they also they do not work in cycles because of the dependency in cycles because of the dependency in cycles because of the dependency graph. It's weird. graph. It's weird. graph. It's weird. Uh let's go and divide this by bits. Uh let's go and divide this by bits. Uh let's go and divide this by bits. Um Um Um go. go. go. It's one of those cases where there It's one of those cases where there It's one of those cases where there should be a better option available, but should be a better option available, but should be a better option available, but there just isn't because of limitations there just isn't because of limitations there just isn't because of limitations in the shader editor. Again, just like in the shader editor. Again, just like in the shader editor. Again, just like the texture socket input where the the texture socket input where the the texture socket input where the workaround is using a closure and then a workaround is using a closure and then a workaround is using a closure and then a texture and then doing that, which it texture and then doing that, which it texture and then doing that, which it leads to um cool results. But the having leads to um cool results. But the having leads to um cool results. But the having just a texture input just a texture input just a texture input while it's being worked on, it should be while it's being worked on, it should be while it's being worked on, it should be um um um a little bit more convenient. So, we have that. Let's go and divide So, we have that. Let's go and divide So, we have that. Let's go and divide that by 200. So, here we have all these that by 200. So, here we have all these that by 200. So, here we have all these moving around like little fireflies. moving around like little fireflies. moving around like little fireflies. Oh, yeah. That's pretty cool. I'm not Oh, yeah. That's pretty cool. I'm not Oh, yeah. That's pretty cool. I'm not sure. I don't think they actually move sure. I don't think they actually move sure. I don't think they actually move in the game. Again, I was just watching in the game. Again, I was just watching in the game. Again, I was just watching it on a uh it on a uh it on a uh a stream that my friend was doing, so I a stream that my friend was doing, so I a stream that my friend was doing, so I did not get to see it uncompressed and did not get to see it uncompressed and did not get to see it uncompressed and everything. everything. everything. As we can see, As we can see, As we can see, it's not bad. Do we turn the detail down it's not bad. Do we turn the detail down it's not bad. Do we turn the detail down or up? That down's fine. And then that or up? That down's fine. And then that or up? That down's fine. And then that it just looks like it just looks like it just looks like I think like that's better. The kind of I think like that's better. The kind of I think like that's better. The kind of firefly look, but we can still use firefly look, but we can still use firefly look, but we can still use random random random into a color ramp. into a color ramp. into a color ramp. Oh, I wonder if the Oh, I wonder if the Oh, I wonder if the I wonder if the closure subtypes will be I wonder if the closure subtypes will be I wonder if the closure subtypes will be added in 5.1. I kind of doubt it cuz I added in 5.1. I kind of doubt it cuz I added in 5.1. I kind of doubt it cuz I haven't seen any work on I haven't heard haven't seen any work on I haven't heard haven't seen any work on I haven't heard any news on that PR in a while. That any news on that PR in a while. That any news on that PR in a while. That would be so good if we got that, but would be so good if we got that, but would be so good if we got that, but probably 5.2 too. If not, we have that. So, we can just pick the we have that. So, we can just pick the we have that. So, we can just pick the colors colors colors there there there and right there. That's That's pretty and right there. That's That's pretty and right there. That's That's pretty cool. So, now I just need to get a somewhat So, now I just need to get a somewhat So, now I just need to get a somewhat interesting looking cityscape. interesting looking cityscape. interesting looking cityscape. And again, this is a fairly okay, maybe And again, this is a fairly okay, maybe And again, this is a fairly okay, maybe not the simplest setup, but not the simplest setup, but not the simplest setup, but you just get do a bit of vector math and you just get do a bit of vector math and you just get do a bit of vector math and then it can act like a geo nodes to a then it can act like a geo nodes to a then it can act like a geo nodes to a degree. Again, it's super fast because degree. Again, it's super fast because degree. Again, it's super fast because we're offloading we're offloading we're offloading all the dynamic computations onto the all the dynamic computations onto the all the dynamic computations onto the GPU, which is great. GPU, which is great. GPU, which is great. If I were to use the actual position or If I were to use the actual position or If I were to use the actual position or no wait, it's using the random part no wait, it's using the random part no wait, it's using the random part there. there. there. Oh yeah. Uh what else? What else do I Oh yeah. Uh what else? What else do I Oh yeah. Uh what else? What else do I want to do? So we have all that and that want to do? So we have all that and that want to do? So we have all that and that I almost want to make it so that these I almost want to make it so that these I almost want to make it so that these all extend downwards all extend downwards all extend downwards and take a look at that. So over here and take a look at that. So over here and take a look at that. So over here that there there there and then doing that. and then doing that. and then doing that. Oh, I'm sensing a bit of lag even though Oh, I'm sensing a bit of lag even though Oh, I'm sensing a bit of lag even though it shouldn't be lagging too much. it shouldn't be lagging too much. it shouldn't be lagging too much. Oh yeah, now it's lagging. Let me go and Oh yeah, now it's lagging. Let me go and Oh yeah, now it's lagging. Let me go and turn shadows down to 0.25 just in case. turn shadows down to 0.25 just in case. turn shadows down to 0.25 just in case. There shouldn't be any shadows in the There shouldn't be any shadows in the There shouldn't be any shadows in the scene. scene. scene. And I feel the lag go away. And I feel the lag go away. And I feel the lag go away. Funnily enough, if you turn off shadows, Funnily enough, if you turn off shadows, Funnily enough, if you turn off shadows, I noticed a performance hit. So having I noticed a performance hit. So having I noticed a performance hit. So having it on is better even if you have it like it on is better even if you have it like it on is better even if you have it like the resolution down to whatever. So, I could still do that, but it looks So, I could still do that, but it looks So, I could still do that, but it looks Well, it looks cool. It's That kind of Well, it looks cool. It's That kind of Well, it looks cool. It's That kind of looks a bit weird. Uhoh, it's a lagging. It's lagging. Oh Uhoh, it's a lagging. It's lagging. Oh Uhoh, it's a lagging. It's lagging. Oh no. no. no. No, it's not actually lag. No, it's not actually lag. No, it's not actually lag. It just zoomed out really far for some It just zoomed out really far for some It just zoomed out really far for some reason. reason. reason. Uh oh. What if I made this green? That's pretty cool. Oh, also I need a That's pretty cool. Oh, also I need a That's pretty cool. Oh, also I need a white noise this so that the the um colors do not coincide with the the um colors do not coincide with the the um colors do not coincide with the the small uh orbs. the small uh orbs. the small uh orbs. That's just so that I can randomize the That's just so that I can randomize the That's just so that I can randomize the colors very easily. So just like add colors very easily. So just like add colors very easily. So just like add plug that into there and then I can plug that into there and then I can plug that into there and then I can easily randomize all that. But in this easily randomize all that. But in this easily randomize all that. But in this case, having a seed value of basically case, having a seed value of basically case, having a seed value of basically zero is okay. So maybe something like that. A nice So maybe something like that. A nice So maybe something like that. A nice green and cool blue. green and cool blue. green and cool blue. I think that's pretty cool. I think that I think that's pretty cool. I think that I think that's pretty cool. I think that works quite well. We don't have works quite well. We don't have works quite well. We don't have instancing on the GPU instancing on the GPU instancing on the GPU or like just scattering on the GPU, but or like just scattering on the GPU, but or like just scattering on the GPU, but that would be cool as well cuz these that would be cool as well cuz these that would be cool as well cuz these could also be points because in could also be points because in could also be points because in you can't displace points in cycles, but you can't displace points in cycles, but you can't displace points in cycles, but you can in Eevee, which I wish we could you can in Eevee, which I wish we could you can in Eevee, which I wish we could displace points in cycles. That would be displace points in cycles. That would be displace points in cycles. That would be very, very nice, but alas, we cannot very, very nice, but alas, we cannot very, very nice, but alas, we cannot last time I checked. That would be such a cool environment to That would be such a cool environment to That would be such a cool environment to see like in VR just looking around. It's see like in VR just looking around. It's see like in VR just looking around. It's just like wow pretty. Hopefully not too just like wow pretty. Hopefully not too just like wow pretty. Hopefully not too computationally expensive. Even though computationally expensive. Even though computationally expensive. Even though alpha plus VR does not work well alpha plus VR does not work well alpha plus VR does not work well if remember correctly. It's been a while if remember correctly. It's been a while if remember correctly. It's been a while since I've tried VR stuff. since I've tried VR stuff. since I've tried VR stuff. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, there we go. Let's have this and then it lays out an Let's have this and then it lays out an Let's have this and then it lays out an entire scene. entire scene. entire scene. Everything is possible if you have a Everything is possible if you have a Everything is possible if you have a good enough imagination. good enough imagination. good enough imagination. in the scene time node in the shader in the scene time node in the shader in the scene time node in the shader editor. So, I could make these any shape I want. So, I could make these any shape I want. So, I could make these any shape I want. I think it's like what what do I want? I think it's like what what do I want? I think it's like what what do I want? Do I want it to just be square or a Do I want it to just be square or a Do I want it to just be square or a little bit of that? Could add in a bit little bit of that? Could add in a bit little bit of that? Could add in a bit of noise just to make it look a bit of noise just to make it look a bit of noise just to make it look a bit cooler. But I do kind of like the star cooler. But I do kind of like the star cooler. But I do kind of like the star shape right there. shape right there. shape right there. And also, in theory, I could make these And also, in theory, I could make these And also, in theory, I could make these face towards the camera. Or actually, face towards the camera. Or actually, face towards the camera. Or actually, can I? Potentially, I could potentially can I? Potentially, I could potentially can I? Potentially, I could potentially make these face towards the camera, but make these face towards the camera, but make these face towards the camera, but that would be very annoying to do on the that would be very annoying to do on the that would be very annoying to do on the GPU with the shader editor, but I think GPU with the shader editor, but I think GPU with the shader editor, but I think it's fine. We're at 48 minutes. Okay, so it's fine. We're at 48 minutes. Okay, so it's fine. We're at 48 minutes. Okay, so the timing is working out quite well cuz the timing is working out quite well cuz the timing is working out quite well cuz the effect is basically done. I can just the effect is basically done. I can just the effect is basically done. I can just go and make it so that Oh, what kind of go and make it so that Oh, what kind of go and make it so that Oh, what kind of shape do I want? Do I want a echosphere shape do I want? Do I want a echosphere shape do I want? Do I want a echosphere with these as well? Cuz that's possible, with these as well? Cuz that's possible, with these as well? Cuz that's possible, too. just like and boom, you have your scene laid out and boom, you have your scene laid out and boom, you have your scene laid out like that. It's almost like working with like that. It's almost like working with like that. It's almost like working with gajon splats gajon splats gajon splats just like oh you just have points and just like oh you just have points and just like oh you just have points and you can move them around you can move them around you can move them around like that and then again it looks quite like that and then again it looks quite like that and then again it looks quite cool. Quite cool. Oh, we have 36 people cool. Quite cool. Oh, we have 36 people cool. Quite cool. Oh, we have 36 people here. 41 people here. It just here. 41 people here. It just here. 41 people here. It just automatically updated. How about that? automatically updated. How about that? automatically updated. How about that? Why are you all here? Uh, but welcome. Why are you all here? Uh, but welcome. Why are you all here? Uh, but welcome. Welcome. I'm going to wrap things up Welcome. I'm going to wrap things up Welcome. I'm going to wrap things up pretty cool. Uh, pretty quickly. We go. I don't know what else to do. We go. I don't know what else to do. We go. I don't know what else to do. Again to summarize the effect, it's Again to summarize the effect, it's Again to summarize the effect, it's basically just instancing a little plane basically just instancing a little plane basically just instancing a little plane on points, realizing the instances, then on points, realizing the instances, then on points, realizing the instances, then using the data stored in here to uh using the data stored in here to uh using the data stored in here to uh basically do displacement in the shader basically do displacement in the shader basically do displacement in the shader editor. It's uh that's the stuff. So sad I missed the beginning, but you So sad I missed the beginning, but you So sad I missed the beginning, but you can just rewatch it. You can just can just rewatch it. You can just can just rewatch it. You can just rewatch it. It'll be fine. That looks cool. That looks cool. That looks cool. At least try. I don't know why, but this At least try. I don't know why, but this At least try. I don't know why, but this is this is giving my brain like Netflix is this is giving my brain like Netflix is this is giving my brain like Netflix intro vibes. Maybe it's just because the intro vibes. Maybe it's just because the intro vibes. Maybe it's just because the vertical things there. Um, let them vertical things there. Um, let them vertical things there. Um, let them collide and bounce. That would be very collide and bounce. That would be very collide and bounce. That would be very difficult to implement though. my easing difficult to implement though. my easing difficult to implement though. my easing functions which I have not ported to the functions which I have not ported to the functions which I have not ported to the shader editor yet. But I could go and do shader editor yet. But I could go and do shader editor yet. But I could go and do something like load curve which which which uh I could do something like because uh I could do something like because uh I could do something like because this is inverted. this is inverted. this is inverted. Is it? Let's just try this Is it? Let's just try this Is it? Let's just try this that that and that. So here that that and that. So here that that and that. So here uh there we go. uh there we go. uh there we go. Here, I could make them just bounce when Here, I could make them just bounce when Here, I could make them just bounce when they fall, but it unless it were highly they fall, but it unless it were highly they fall, but it unless it were highly randomized, it wouldn't look that great. randomized, it wouldn't look that great. randomized, it wouldn't look that great. Uh, well, let's let's give it a shot. Uh, well, let's let's give it a shot. Uh, well, let's let's give it a shot. It's like that. Bounce, bounce, bounce. It's like that. Bounce, bounce, bounce. It's like that. Bounce, bounce, bounce. Uh, when closure subtypes become a Uh, when closure subtypes become a Uh, when closure subtypes become a thing, we may get the like easing thing, we may get the like easing thing, we may get the like easing handles on these, which would be so handles on these, which would be so handles on these, which would be so nice. I want that so bad. nice. I want that so bad. nice. I want that so bad. And with motion blur, uh, little tip, if And with motion blur, uh, little tip, if And with motion blur, uh, little tip, if you want to do motion blur with alpha you want to do motion blur with alpha you want to do motion blur with alpha blend things, you just need to turn up blend things, you just need to turn up blend things, you just need to turn up the substeps. The actual blur will not the substeps. The actual blur will not the substeps. The actual blur will not happen on alpha blend stuff because it happen on alpha blend stuff because it happen on alpha blend stuff because it only realizes real meshes. only realizes real meshes. only realizes real meshes. So, if you have an object moving, why do So, if you have an object moving, why do So, if you have an object moving, why do we have 56 people here? Why do why why we have 56 people here? Why do why why we have 56 people here? Why do why why are you all showing up? I don't get it. are you all showing up? I don't get it. are you all showing up? I don't get it. Um, guess I need to actually make this Um, guess I need to actually make this Um, guess I need to actually make this interesting now. Yeah, let's add in uh interesting now. Yeah, let's add in uh interesting now. Yeah, let's add in uh some more shapes just to make this look some more shapes just to make this look some more shapes just to make this look uh cooler. Let's add in a donut in the uh cooler. Let's add in a donut in the uh cooler. Let's add in a donut in the sky cuz that looks cool. sky cuz that looks cool. sky cuz that looks cool. Yeah, that that looks cool. Let me also Yeah, that that looks cool. Let me also Yeah, that that looks cool. Let me also get the camera set up. Uh if you have a get the camera set up. Uh if you have a get the camera set up. Uh if you have a real mesh or material moving in back of real mesh or material moving in back of real mesh or material moving in back of alpha plane stuff, it the motion blur alpha plane stuff, it the motion blur alpha plane stuff, it the motion blur will affect the alpha plane. will affect the alpha plane. will affect the alpha plane. Also, I recently learned during my Also, I recently learned during my Also, I recently learned during my projects that um depth of field does not projects that um depth of field does not projects that um depth of field does not get motion blurred. It will do the get motion blurred. It will do the get motion blurred. It will do the motion blur first and then motion blur first and then motion blur first and then the al uh then the depth of field which the al uh then the depth of field which the al uh then the depth of field which can make it look like your motion blur can make it look like your motion blur can make it look like your motion blur is not applying. So, just turn up the is not applying. So, just turn up the is not applying. So, just turn up the steps to like three. Anyway, steps to like three. Anyway, steps to like three. Anyway, see, I've been waiting for 5.1. Finally, see, I've been waiting for 5.1. Finally, see, I've been waiting for 5.1. Finally, the video editor and compositor are the video editor and compositor are the video editor and compositor are getting some love. In 5.0, 0 the video getting some love. In 5.0, 0 the video getting some love. In 5.0, 0 the video editor and compositor got a huge update editor and compositor got a huge update editor and compositor got a huge update which I'm so happy about which I'm so happy about which I'm so happy about that this looks so cool. I just feel that this looks so cool. I just feel that this looks so cool. I just feel like it needs a little bit more like I like it needs a little bit more like I like it needs a little bit more like I need to scale the need to scale the need to scale the like I need to scale these parts like I need to scale these parts like I need to scale these parts randomly which I could do because again randomly which I could do because again randomly which I could do because again this side is only on the CPU. I can add this side is only on the CPU. I can add this side is only on the CPU. I can add in a random value. This does not in a random value. This does not in a random value. This does not recalculate every frame. If the mesh recalculate every frame. If the mesh recalculate every frame. If the mesh doesn't move, all this is still doesn't move, all this is still doesn't move, all this is still performance. Very good for performance. performance. Very good for performance. performance. Very good for performance. Here I can set that to be that that do Here I can set that to be that that do Here I can set that to be that that do that. So that's 0.25. that. So that's 0.25. that. So that's 0.25. So I can have something like this. And So I can have something like this. And So I can have something like this. And then then then so cool. So cool. Uh let's see. Did you so cool. So cool. Uh let's see. Did you so cool. So cool. Uh let's see. Did you join uh did you see Netflix join the join uh did you see Netflix join the join uh did you see Netflix join the Blender development fund? I did. And if Blender development fund? I did. And if Blender development fund? I did. And if anyone's concerned about that, you anyone's concerned about that, you anyone's concerned about that, you should not be because it's the deal is should not be because it's the deal is should not be because it's the deal is basically Netflix gives Blender money basically Netflix gives Blender money basically Netflix gives Blender money and that's it. and that's it. and that's it. Uh, as far as I know, there are no Uh, as far as I know, there are no Uh, as far as I know, there are no strings attached. Adobe has been even strings attached. Adobe has been even strings attached. Adobe has been even donating to Blender already. Blender is donating to Blender already. Blender is donating to Blender already. Blender is just becoming very important uh just becoming very important uh just becoming very important uh infrastructure for visual effects or infrastructure for visual effects or infrastructure for visual effects or just animation and visual effects in just animation and visual effects in just animation and visual effects in general. So, you should not be scared general. So, you should not be scared general. So, you should not be scared about that. Oh. Oh, that that I like about that. Oh. Oh, that that I like about that. Oh. Oh, that that I like that. That's cool. That is cool. Oh, and I could also make That is cool. Oh, and I could also make That is cool. Oh, and I could also make it so that the the noise is scaled by it so that the the noise is scaled by it so that the the noise is scaled by the thing as well. Oh, it's starting to the thing as well. Oh, it's starting to the thing as well. Oh, it's starting to lag now, though. May maybe I'm overdoing lag now, though. May maybe I'm overdoing lag now, though. May maybe I'm overdoing the amount of uh mesh planes. If we set the amount of uh mesh planes. If we set the amount of uh mesh planes. If we set that to be like 10, we can see that to be like 10, we can see that to be like 10, we can see then set that to be one. It's like that. then set that to be one. It's like that. then set that to be one. It's like that. Okay. It it doesn't look okay. Looks okay, but It it doesn't look okay. Looks okay, but It it doesn't look okay. Looks okay, but not the best if I'm being honest. These not the best if I'm being honest. These not the best if I'm being honest. These would need more subdivisions, which I would need more subdivisions, which I would need more subdivisions, which I could try, but I'm a little worried could try, but I'm a little worried could try, but I'm a little worried about the speed. We're kind of hitting about the speed. We're kind of hitting about the speed. We're kind of hitting the Oh my gosh, the Oh my gosh, the Oh my gosh, we're kind of hitting the limit of um we're kind of hitting the limit of um we're kind of hitting the limit of um uh what's efficient with all this. uh what's efficient with all this. uh what's efficient with all this. Actually, the subdivisions Actually, the subdivisions Actually, the subdivisions aren't doing anything there. Thought it aren't doing anything there. Thought it aren't doing anything there. Thought it would. Oh, right. Because the noise would. Oh, right. Because the noise would. Oh, right. Because the noise texture is not location based. texture is not location based. texture is not location based. If this were location based, If this were location based, If this were location based, um, it would look very different. Maybe um, it would look very different. Maybe um, it would look very different. Maybe better, maybe worse. I'm actually not better, maybe worse. I'm actually not better, maybe worse. I'm actually not sure, but let's let's give it a shot sure, but let's let's give it a shot sure, but let's let's give it a shot in this case. in this case. in this case. Okay, we can see we can see it looks a Okay, we can see we can see it looks a Okay, we can see we can see it looks a little bit different. Maybe I need to little bit different. Maybe I need to little bit different. Maybe I need to adjust the scale. So that's a little adjust the scale. So that's a little adjust the scale. So that's a little more more more one. There we go. So here it's a bit one. There we go. So here it's a bit one. There we go. So here it's a bit more like bit more warped, bit cooler. more like bit more warped, bit cooler. more like bit more warped, bit cooler. But I think the default is fine. Let's But I think the default is fine. Let's But I think the default is fine. Let's not even scale it. I think it's fine not even scale it. I think it's fine not even scale it. I think it's fine regardless. regardless. regardless. I think that's everything for today. We I think that's everything for today. We I think that's everything for today. We are at 55 minutes, so I think I'll go are at 55 minutes, so I think I'll go are at 55 minutes, so I think I'll go and uh wrap things up. and uh wrap things up. and uh wrap things up. Uh if you have any last questions about Uh if you have any last questions about Uh if you have any last questions about Blender 5.1 or you know just Blender Blender 5.1 or you know just Blender Blender 5.1 or you know just Blender stuff in general, ask them now. stuff in general, ask them now. stuff in general, ask them now. Oh, and I could also store the normals Oh, and I could also store the normals Oh, and I could also store the normals for all this can lead to some cool for all this can lead to some cool for all this can lead to some cool shader effects. So since the normal is shader effects. So since the normal is shader effects. So since the normal is stored when you distribute points on stored when you distribute points on stored when you distribute points on faces, I could go and store that here. faces, I could go and store that here. faces, I could go and store that here. Let's just make this norm Let's just make this norm Let's just make this norm and plug that into there. Go. Let's go to the shader editor and Go. Let's go to the shader editor and Go. Let's go to the shader editor and get that attributes which is the norm. get that attributes which is the norm. get that attributes which is the norm. I'm also looking forward to when we get I'm also looking forward to when we get I'm also looking forward to when we get like string inputs in the shader editor like string inputs in the shader editor like string inputs in the shader editor so that we can go and like have string so that we can go and like have string so that we can go and like have string inputs here and for especially the UV inputs here and for especially the UV inputs here and for especially the UV tangent node because I have a node tangent node because I have a node tangent node because I have a node group. group. group. Uh because where's the Uh because where's the Uh because where's the where's the where's the where's the tangent? Which one is it? tangent? Which one is it? tangent? Which one is it? math input tangent because this one has math input tangent because this one has math input tangent because this one has a UV map input, but you cannot access a UV map input, but you cannot access a UV map input, but you cannot access this from inside a node group. I have a this from inside a node group. I have a this from inside a node group. I have a node group that uses this, but um yeah, node group that uses this, but um yeah, node group that uses this, but um yeah, we need we need the ability to input we need we need the ability to input we need we need the ability to input that from outside. Oh, and I need to that from outside. Oh, and I need to that from outside. Oh, and I need to show you my data block to string node show you my data block to string node show you my data block to string node that I'm working on. That will not be in that I'm working on. That will not be in that I'm working on. That will not be in 5.1, but maybe it'll be um later. So, 5.1, but maybe it'll be um later. So, 5.1, but maybe it'll be um later. So, here I can go and get the normals of all here I can go and get the normals of all here I can go and get the normals of all this. So if something is pointing up this. So if something is pointing up this. So if something is pointing up something like that, I can now harvest something like that, I can now harvest something like that, I can now harvest that data which also if I go and shade that data which also if I go and shade that data which also if I go and shade smooth it uh smooth shades that data as smooth it uh smooth shades that data as smooth it uh smooth shades that data as well that can be used for very well that can be used for very well that can be used for very interesting effects as well. So if I interesting effects as well. So if I interesting effects as well. So if I were to go into the shader editor were to go into the shader editor were to go into the shader editor and then use the norm to affect the and then use the norm to affect the and then use the norm to affect the color. I'm just going to put in the dot color. I'm just going to put in the dot color. I'm just going to put in the dot product. There product. There product. There we go. You can go and make it like that. we go. You can go and make it like that. we go. You can go and make it like that. Or conversely, conversely, Or conversely, conversely, Or conversely, conversely, something like that. And we bring the something like that. And we bring the something like that. And we bring the shadows down to something like that. shadows down to something like that. shadows down to something like that. Have something like that. I could also Have something like that. I could also Have something like that. I could also map range this to make it look even map range this to make it look even map range this to make it look even cooler. cooler. cooler. But yeah, basically I want to keep it But yeah, basically I want to keep it But yeah, basically I want to keep it dark, but not too dark. But yeah, if you dark, but not too dark. But yeah, if you dark, but not too dark. But yeah, if you want a representation of a donut or want a representation of a donut or want a representation of a donut or anything like that, you can go and do anything like that, you can go and do anything like that, you can go and do that. just getting data, storing it, and that. just getting data, storing it, and that. just getting data, storing it, and then using it in the shader editor. But then using it in the shader editor. But then using it in the shader editor. But for now, oh, that actually that looks for now, oh, that actually that looks for now, oh, that actually that looks cool, too. cool, too. cool, too. So much is possible in that. That's very cool. So, again, just that. That's very cool. So, again, just that. That's very cool. So, again, just taking a look at this. It's just taking a look at this. It's just taking a look at this. It's just all that appears. all that appears. all that appears. That would be a cool post. Though I need That would be a cool post. Though I need That would be a cool post. Though I need to make the background a little more to make the background a little more to make the background a little more visually interesting. If I were to go visually interesting. If I were to go visually interesting. If I were to go and join the initial geometry to the and join the initial geometry to the and join the initial geometry to the fold, fold, fold, it will have a different material. So, it will have a different material. So, it will have a different material. So, it shouldn't with everything else at it shouldn't with everything else at it shouldn't with everything else at least in theory. least in theory. least in theory. That do that. Turn this down. And also, That do that. Turn this down. And also, That do that. Turn this down. And also, oh, right. There is a light in there. We oh, right. There is a light in there. We oh, right. There is a light in there. We do that. That can make things look a do that. That can make things look a do that. That can make things look a little bit Okay. I do like how it collides. Like it Okay. I do like how it collides. Like it Okay. I do like how it collides. Like it makes everything not super visible. Oh, makes everything not super visible. Oh, makes everything not super visible. Oh, wait. I can use the Yeah, let's not do wait. I can use the Yeah, let's not do wait. I can use the Yeah, let's not do that. that. that. But if I go No, I can't ray cast. But if I go No, I can't ray cast. But if I go No, I can't ray cast. The raycast node is not in 5.1. The raycast node is not in 5.1. The raycast node is not in 5.1. Yeah. No, it's not. Yeah. No, it's not. Yeah. No, it's not. could get the vector to the camera and could get the vector to the camera and could get the vector to the camera and then dot product dotproduct that with then dot product dotproduct that with then dot product dotproduct that with the normal to basically get a frenel. the normal to basically get a frenel. the normal to basically get a frenel. But no, I could actually get the frenel But no, I could actually get the frenel But no, I could actually get the frenel node and input the normal that I desire. node and input the normal that I desire. node and input the normal that I desire. So if I go and use a or layer weight So if I go and use a or layer weight So if I go and use a or layer weight node would be a little bit better in node would be a little bit better in node would be a little bit better in this case. So that plug the normal into this case. So that plug the normal into this case. So that plug the normal into there. Take a look at this. We can see there. Take a look at this. We can see there. Take a look at this. We can see that we're getting a pseudo or yeah just that we're getting a pseudo or yeah just that we're getting a pseudo or yeah just for now using the normal that we stored. for now using the normal that we stored. for now using the normal that we stored. Then we can use that for the layer Then we can use that for the layer Then we can use that for the layer weight. And then with that as well, weight. And then with that as well, weight. And then with that as well, see that we're getting make it making it see that we're getting make it making it see that we're getting make it making it look like it has some actual volume to look like it has some actual volume to look like it has some actual volume to it. it. it. But if I did that, But if I did that, But if I did that, h I would be able to get the back facing h I would be able to get the back facing h I would be able to get the back facing things. If I were to subtract with the things. If I were to subtract with the things. If I were to subtract with the current position of the camera, which if current position of the camera, which if current position of the camera, which if I'm being honest, how do I go and do I'm being honest, how do I go and do I'm being honest, how do I go and do that? I need to get the attributes. that? I need to get the attributes. that? I need to get the attributes. need to get the view layer thing and need to get the view layer thing and need to get the view layer thing and then I need to get the location of you then I need to get the location of you then I need to get the location of you which the full data path which the full data path which the full data path bring it into here bring it into here bring it into here location no not location one this should location no not location one this should location no not location one this should be be be ah there we go okay so we can subtract ah there we go okay so we can subtract ah there we go okay so we can subtract that with the position that with the position that with the position dangif almost 50 people here I am dangif almost 50 people here I am dangif almost 50 people here I am shocked but with this we can get the shocked but with this we can get the shocked but with this we can get the vector to the camera we need normalize vector to the camera we need normalize vector to the camera we need normalize this as well so that the vectors have a this as well so that the vectors have a this as well so that the vectors have a length of one. We do that and that then length of one. We do that and that then length of one. We do that and that then we dotproduct it that we should get a we dotproduct it that we should get a we dotproduct it that we should get a gradient that is facing the camera gradient that is facing the camera gradient that is facing the camera almost like the Fresnel almost like the Fresnel almost like the Fresnel if I did it correctly which I think I if I did it correctly which I think I if I did it correctly which I think I need to invert those two. There we go. need to invert those two. There we go. need to invert those two. There we go. Yep, we can see that this is facing the Yep, we can see that this is facing the Yep, we can see that this is facing the camera. So it almost looks like a light camera. So it almost looks like a light camera. So it almost looks like a light is shining there which it won't actually is shining there which it won't actually is shining there which it won't actually collide with the objects because it's collide with the objects because it's collide with the objects because it's not an actual raycast. we can't detect not an actual raycast. we can't detect not an actual raycast. we can't detect when something is actually hitting. when something is actually hitting. when something is actually hitting. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. And then yeah, so this basically makes And then yeah, so this basically makes And then yeah, so this basically makes it so that we can see a pseudo shadow it so that we can see a pseudo shadow it so that we can see a pseudo shadow even though it again will not collide even though it again will not collide even though it again will not collide with everything else in the scene. And with everything else in the scene. And with everything else in the scene. And also this is kind of how you get um also this is kind of how you get um also this is kind of how you get um I guess like a completely linear uh FEL I guess like a completely linear uh FEL I guess like a completely linear uh FEL even though I think if you were to set even though I think if you were to set even though I think if you were to set that to one that would be pretty much that to one that would be pretty much that to one that would be pretty much but what I want is the negative values but what I want is the negative values but what I want is the negative values so that I can go and play around with so that I can go and play around with so that I can go and play around with that in here. that in here. that in here. Basically making the parts that are in Basically making the parts that are in Basically making the parts that are in the back invisible essentially. So if I the back invisible essentially. So if I the back invisible essentially. So if I were to go and scale were to go and scale were to go and scale the things there. the things there. the things there. You can see that we are basically You can see that we are basically You can see that we are basically getting getting getting we're basically oluding the back face as we're basically oluding the back face as we're basically oluding the back face as well of all these even though again well of all these even though again well of all these even though again it's not 100% accurate as we can see it's not 100% accurate as we can see it's not 100% accurate as we can see there there there actually wait it shouldn't be show oh actually wait it shouldn't be show oh actually wait it shouldn't be show oh because of the yeah I shade auto smooth I shade auto smooth and then we put this I shade auto smooth and then we put this I shade auto smooth and then we put this before else yeah there we go to be like before else yeah there we go to be like before else yeah there we go to be like It will it'll include everything that's It will it'll include everything that's It will it'll include everything that's not like facing the right way. Basically not like facing the right way. Basically not like facing the right way. Basically is back facing. is back facing. is back facing. Need you in there. Yep. That is that Need you in there. Yep. That is that Need you in there. Yep. That is that again. Works pretty well. If we move the Works pretty well. If we move the Works pretty well. If we move the camera, everything will work as camera, everything will work as camera, everything will work as intended. intended. intended. But I think we need to use a map range But I think we need to use a map range But I think we need to use a map range instead because I want to go and play instead because I want to go and play instead because I want to go and play around with some of the values. around with some of the values. around with some of the values. Also, I want to plug you into there Also, I want to plug you into there Also, I want to plug you into there because I want to see what a linear because I want to see what a linear because I want to see what a linear falloff looks like with all that. Yep, falloff looks like with all that. Yep, falloff looks like with all that. Yep, that looks exactly as expected. We're that looks exactly as expected. We're that looks exactly as expected. We're over an hour. I need to uh wrap this up over an hour. I need to uh wrap this up over an hour. I need to uh wrap this up really quickly. really quickly. really quickly. I'm still preferring the just golden I'm still preferring the just golden I'm still preferring the just golden orange look like the the sunrise orange. orange look like the the sunrise orange. orange look like the the sunrise orange. 25. And then again, I can make it so 25. And then again, I can make it so 25. And then again, I can make it so that the back is actually shown but just that the back is actually shown but just that the back is actually shown but just toned down. do that and that we can see. toned down. do that and that we can see. toned down. do that and that we can see. Yep. More opposite it goes, the more it Yep. More opposite it goes, the more it Yep. More opposite it goes, the more it looks like that right there. It looks looks like that right there. It looks looks like that right there. It looks like that. But it's all too necessary. like that. But it's all too necessary. like that. But it's all too necessary. Maybe 0.25 to.25 Maybe 0.25 to.25 Maybe 0.25 to.25 would be good. I think that's uh I think that's I think that's uh I think that's I think that's uh I think that's acceptable. Then for the actual color, acceptable. Then for the actual color, acceptable. Then for the actual color, well, I'm just going to disable that cuz well, I'm just going to disable that cuz well, I'm just going to disable that cuz I really like the golden orange. I really like the golden orange. I really like the golden orange. Actually, no. that I'll need to play Actually, no. that I'll need to play Actually, no. that I'll need to play around with it a little bit. around with it a little bit. around with it a little bit. Still like the just if we get the Still like the just if we get the Still like the just if we get the Z-axis. That one does look good. One does look That one does look good. One does look That one does look good. One does look good. Even though I could map range to good. Even though I could map range to good. Even though I could map range to make it look a little bit different make it look a little bit different make it look a little bit different than right there. than right there. than right there. H H H do I do? And then if I do that, we can do I do? And then if I do that, we can do I do? And then if I do that, we can make this a little more generalized. do whatever I want in this world because do whatever I want in this world because do whatever I want in this world because again, it's a nice little sandbox. I again, it's a nice little sandbox. I again, it's a nice little sandbox. I like playing in the little sandbox like playing in the little sandbox like playing in the little sandbox instead of having a computer do it for instead of having a computer do it for instead of having a computer do it for me. Got to take on AI. Whoop. me. Got to take on AI. Whoop. me. Got to take on AI. Whoop. There we go. Like playing in the digital There we go. Like playing in the digital There we go. Like playing in the digital sandbox. sandbox. sandbox. The green looks good. I always need to The green looks good. I always need to The green looks good. I always need to turn on I need to make a little script turn on I need to make a little script turn on I need to make a little script that always um sets the asper out to be that always um sets the asper out to be that always um sets the asper out to be fully opaque just because I need to see fully opaque just because I need to see fully opaque just because I need to see what the viewport actually finally sees. Don't it's just Don't it's just Don't it's just that ruins everything. that ruins everything. that ruins everything. Get the wrong expectations of the frame Get the wrong expectations of the frame Get the wrong expectations of the frame and then when I render I'm like no it and then when I render I'm like no it and then when I render I'm like no it shouldn't look like that. shouldn't look like that. shouldn't look like that. Actually I like that. Maybe HSV mode. Actually I like that. Maybe HSV mode. Actually I like that. Maybe HSV mode. Make it very rainbow just like uh the new Tamadachi life. See, I'm liking the greens. The The greens I'm liking the greens. The The greens I'm liking the greens. The The greens are looking good. are looking good. are looking good. No, I am liking the greens, though. Maybe keeping these going just Maybe keeping these going just Maybe keeping these going just vertically would be good. Oh, I need to vertically would be good. Oh, I need to vertically would be good. Oh, I need to try making them just go horizontal. try making them just go horizontal. try making them just go horizontal. Oh, that's just the matrix filter. Oh, that's just the matrix filter. Oh, that's just the matrix filter. Just the matrix filter there. It's like Just the matrix filter there. It's like Just the matrix filter there. It's like Oh, that's it almost works, but since Oh, that's it almost works, but since Oh, that's it almost works, but since the uh the other displacement is going the uh the other displacement is going the uh the other displacement is going vertical, that um or the UV is going vertical, that um or the UV is going vertical, that um or the UV is going vertical, that doesn't mesh all too vertical, that doesn't mesh all too vertical, that doesn't mesh all too well. Let's try that way. well. Let's try that way. well. Let's try that way. It does look a bit weird with uh the It does look a bit weird with uh the It does look a bit weird with uh the tops and bottoms doing that. Yeah, I think vertical is the way to go. Yeah, I think vertical is the way to go. Yeah, I think vertical is the way to go. Or what we had before where it was just Or what we had before where it was just Or what we had before where it was just um a really trippy a really trippy a really trippy where it was just like where it was just like where it was just like Extreme Extreme Extreme perspective works well. So yeah, green perspective works well. So yeah, green perspective works well. So yeah, green is an option. Let me go and just put is an option. Let me go and just put is an option. Let me go and just put that to the side. Let's go and get the that to the side. Let's go and get the that to the side. Let's go and get the very nice looking very nice looking very nice looking oranges there. Looks a little bit too oranges there. Looks a little bit too oranges there. Looks a little bit too detailed, so I need to find a way of detailed, so I need to find a way of detailed, so I need to find a way of making that look better. Also need to making that look better. Also need to making that look better. Also need to try Okay, the blues always look good. try Okay, the blues always look good. try Okay, the blues always look good. Uh, okay.

But they start to complain and retract funds. I hope the complain and retract funds. I hope the complain and retract funds. I hope the foundation will not bend under the foundation will not bend under the foundation will not bend under the demands. I a lot of corporate sabotage demands. I a lot of corporate sabotage demands. I a lot of corporate sabotage with white gloves happening with the with white gloves happening with the with white gloves happening with the open software. I doubt that'll be the open software. I doubt that'll be the open software. I doubt that'll be the case. Especially if they go after case. Especially if they go after case. Especially if they go after Blender, there will be a lot of negative Blender, there will be a lot of negative Blender, there will be a lot of negative press and I don't think they would enjoy press and I don't think they would enjoy press and I don't think they would enjoy that. I wonder what their demands would that. I wonder what their demands would that. I wonder what their demands would be. I wonder what they would be as someone who has well I cannot say as someone who has well I cannot say as someone who has well I cannot say never mind complete. Uh forget that never mind complete.

I have a little bit of insight into the I have a little bit of insight into the I have a little bit of insight into the corporate uh and Blender ties, but not corporate uh and Blender ties, but not corporate uh and Blender ties, but not too much. But it has not been bad. Has too much. But it has not been bad. Has too much. But it has not been bad. Has not been bad. Make that two dimensions not been bad. Make that two dimensions not been bad. Make that two dimensions because we're using the UV map. Not with Netflix. I need to specify that Not with Netflix. I need to specify that Not with Netflix.

Oh, wait. We don't have that. Using the Oh, wait. We don't have that. Using the Oh, wait. We don't have that. Using the hashtag frame. I'm going to make that hashtag frame. I'm going to make that hashtag frame. I'm going to make that into a node group into a node group into a node group because if you copy something with the because if you copy something with the because if you copy something with the driver, it does not copy. driver, it does not copy. driver, it does not copy. So basically having a se So basically having a se So basically having a se # frame node group unfortunately is the # frame node group unfortunately is the # frame node group unfortunately is the way to go. Unfortunately, h I I I I need to get that in there h I I I I need to get that in there h I I I I need to get that in there somehow. I do not know the shader editor somehow. I do not know the shader editor somehow. I do not know the shader editor code. I was looking at the texture node code. I was looking at the texture node code. I was looking at the texture node and the old texture node. It is so old. and the old texture node. It is so old. and the old texture node. It is so old. It's from 2005 and uh and uh and uh There we go. Yeah, a little bit of wispy There we go. Yeah, a little bit of wispy There we go. Yeah, a little bit of wispy stuff looks cool as well, making it look stuff looks cool as well, making it look stuff looks cool as well, making it look very warbly. I guess again, my only very warbly. I guess again, my only very warbly. I guess again, my only complaint with this at the moment is complaint with this at the moment is complaint with this at the moment is that it looks too detailed with that it looks too detailed with that it looks too detailed with everything going on. I need to make it everything going on. I need to make it everything going on. I need to make it less detailed. Also, I should also Oh, less detailed. Also, I should also Oh, less detailed. Also, I should also Oh, no. The UV map is actually stored no. The UV map is actually stored no. The UV map is actually stored automatically because it's a named automatically because it's a named automatically because it's a named attribute. So, UV map. If I go and take attribute. So, UV map. If I go and take attribute. So, UV map. If I go and take a look at that, we can see. Yep. The Oh, a look at that, we can see. Yep. The Oh, a look at that, we can see. Yep. The Oh, wait. No, I need to make the name wait. No, I need to make the name wait. No, I need to make the name different because there's a name different because there's a name different because there's a name collision collision collision here. I'll just make this UV map one. here. I'll just make this UV map one. here. I'll just make this UV map one. So, that when it's accessed here, it'll So, that when it's accessed here, it'll So, that when it's accessed here, it'll go and get the Yeah. the underlying UV go and get the Yeah. the underlying UV go and get the Yeah. the underlying UV map of the mesh. So, a lot is map of the mesh. So, a lot is map of the mesh. So, a lot is can be done here. Use depth of field can be done here. Use depth of field can be done here. Use depth of field with your camera. That does not work with your camera. That does not work with your camera. That does not work with uh alpha blend unless I use the with uh alpha blend unless I use the with uh alpha blend unless I use the jitter depth of field which will take so jitter depth of field which will take so jitter depth of field which will take so many samples to actually uh many samples to actually uh many samples to actually uh implement but I'll give it a shot. So implement but I'll give it a shot. So implement but I'll give it a shot. So here we can see that the depth of field here we can see that the depth of field here we can see that the depth of field does not appear to be working. That's does not appear to be working. That's does not appear to be working. That's simply because it doesn't actually know simply because it doesn't actually know simply because it doesn't actually know where to go. So if I go to depth of where to go. So if I go to depth of where to go. So if I go to depth of field and jitter camera, field and jitter camera, field and jitter camera, it will make it so that it works. But I it will make it so that it works. But I it will make it so that it works. But I need to turn the blur down to basically need to turn the blur down to basically need to turn the blur down to basically zero. zero. zero. So the max size needs to be zero. So the max size needs to be zero. So the max size needs to be zero. Then Then Then hello. Oh, and because of EV next again, hello. Oh, and because of EV next again, hello. Oh, and because of EV next again, jitter depth of field is not visible in jitter depth of field is not visible in jitter depth of field is not visible in the viewport. It's only visible in the the viewport. It's only visible in the the viewport. It's only visible in the render unlike with EV legacy where you render unlike with EV legacy where you render unlike with EV legacy where you could see that in the thing. So if I do could see that in the thing. So if I do could see that in the thing. So if I do that, we can see that it renders in 1.73 that, we can see that it renders in 1.73 that, we can see that it renders in 1.73 seconds. Yeah, which is a little expensive for Yeah, which is a little expensive for Yeah, which is a little expensive for something with no shadows something with no shadows something with no shadows is only alpha blend. Oh, if you turn is only alpha blend. Oh, if you turn is only alpha blend. Oh, if you turn shadows off, it changes it from shadows off, it changes it from shadows off, it changes it from again, these are shadows where it's again, these are shadows where it's again, these are shadows where it's hitting nothing. hitting nothing. hitting nothing. It changes it to 0.15 seconds. Uh, no.18 It changes it to 0.15 seconds. Uh, no.18 It changes it to 0.15 seconds. Uh, no.18 seconds. seconds. seconds. So again, shadows are the most expensive So again, shadows are the most expensive So again, shadows are the most expensive part of Eevee. Next, so keep those as part of Eevee. Next, so keep those as part of Eevee. Next, so keep those as low as you can possibly have them. low as you can possibly have them. low as you can possibly have them. Again, yeah, keep them as low because Again, yeah, keep them as low because Again, yeah, keep them as low because they are just extremely expensive even they are just extremely expensive even they are just extremely expensive even if they're not hitting anything. if they're not hitting anything. if they're not hitting anything. Yeah, depth of field. That helps. Yep. Yeah, depth of field. That helps. Yep. Yeah, depth of field. That helps. Yep. Even though it needs quite a few Even though it needs quite a few Even though it needs quite a few samples, it does help. samples, it does help. samples, it does help. And I'll just need to hone that in And I'll just need to hone that in And I'll just need to hone that in because we cannot see it in the because we cannot see it in the because we cannot see it in the viewports. It is so annoying compared to viewports. It is so annoying compared to viewports. It is so annoying compared to EP Legacy. I know I complain about a EP Legacy. I know I complain about a EP Legacy. I know I complain about a lot. I need to stop doing that. lot. I need to stop doing that. lot. I need to stop doing that. But it since I still I still use Blender But it since I still I still use Blender But it since I still I still use Blender 4.1 for EV Legacy, which is why the 4.1 for EV Legacy, which is why the 4.1 for EV Legacy, which is why the comparisons between the two are always comparisons between the two are always comparisons between the two are always on the brain. I do need to apologize for on the brain. I do need to apologize for on the brain. I do need to apologize for that. I need to stop complaining about that. I need to stop complaining about that. I need to stop complaining about that. I need to stop complaining. that. I need to stop complaining. that. I need to stop complaining. &gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I think for now I'll turn it off just so I think for now I'll turn it off just so I think for now I'll turn it off just so that the two match. that the two match. that the two match. Yeah. Here we have that going. And then Yeah. Here we have that going. And then Yeah. Here we have that going. And then we have the wispy stuff happen. We have we have the wispy stuff happen. We have we have the wispy stuff happen. We have 50 viewers still. 50 viewers still. 50 viewers still. Dang. Okay. Dang. Okay. Dang. Okay. So, yeah, this good enough for today. So, yeah, this good enough for today. So, yeah, this good enough for today. I'll probably just edit the mesh off I'll probably just edit the mesh off I'll probably just edit the mesh off stream to make it look a bit better. stream to make it look a bit better. stream to make it look a bit better. Maybe like a cityscape or something like Maybe like a cityscape or something like Maybe like a cityscape or something like that. I do like the wisp effect. Let's that. I do like the wisp effect. Let's that. I do like the wisp effect. Let's try just a few more colors try just a few more colors try just a few more colors before I go for the day. So again, that before I go for the day. So again, that before I go for the day. So again, that looks good. That also looks good. looks good. That also looks good. looks good. That also looks good. I think I think the blues have it. The I think I think the blues have it. The I think I think the blues have it. The blues always have it. But the purples blues always have it. But the purples blues always have it. But the purples though, look at that. AGX color though, look at that. AGX color though, look at that. AGX color clipping. Ooh, yep. That's why people clipping. Ooh, yep. That's why people clipping. Ooh, yep. That's why people say that ASUS uh or [music] AGX is the say that ASUS uh or [music] AGX is the say that ASUS uh or [music] AGX is the best. ASUS 2.0 causes there to be much best. ASUS 2.0 causes there to be much best. ASUS 2.0 causes there to be much less color clipping. less color clipping. less color clipping. That Oh, That Oh, That Oh, AGX makes things very washed out, but AGX makes things very washed out, but AGX makes things very washed out, but apparently it's just more accurate to apparently it's just more accurate to apparently it's just more accurate to our eyes. And then I could use the our eyes. And then I could use the our eyes. And then I could use the compositor with the compositor with the compositor with the Nope, that's the wrong one. the tune Nope, that's the wrong one. the tune Nope, that's the wrong one. the tune image node and then do a color boost. image node and then do a color boost. image node and then do a color boost. Hello. Oh, the color boost did not nothing. Oh, the color boost did not nothing. Oh, the color boost did not nothing. Oh, Oh, Oh, I would uh I thought that would help. I would uh I thought that would help. I would uh I thought that would help. H clarity and then detail, you know, if H clarity and then detail, you know, if H clarity and then detail, you know, if you want to make it look super deep you want to make it look super deep you want to make it look super deep fried, always an option. Okay. But for fried, always an option. Okay. But for fried, always an option. Okay. But for now, because for this shot, it looks now, because for this shot, it looks now, because for this shot, it looks better. I'm going with Aces 1.3. Then better. I'm going with Aces 1.3. Then better. I'm going with Aces 1.3. Then there's Filmic as well, which uh doesn't there's Filmic as well, which uh doesn't there's Filmic as well, which uh doesn't look as good. So, Aces 1.3 has become my look as good. So, Aces 1.3 has become my look as good. So, Aces 1.3 has become my new best friend. new best friend. new best friend. Let's go and control Z until we're back Let's go and control Z until we're back Let's go and control Z until we're back to there. to there. to there. Mm is gone. Aces 1.3 is my new best Mm is gone. Aces 1.3 is my new best Mm is gone. Aces 1.3 is my new best friend. friend. friend. All right. All right. All right. So, let's read the chat and then uh So, let's read the chat and then uh So, let's read the chat and then uh we'll go for the day. we'll go for the day. we'll go for the day. How many viewers do you usually have How many viewers do you usually have How many viewers do you usually have during a live stream? I would say it's during a live stream? I would say it's during a live stream? I would say it's around the like 24 amount. around the like 24 amount. around the like 24 amount. Like maybe two years ago it like I think Like maybe two years ago it like I think Like maybe two years ago it like I think it reached like 75 at the max which was it reached like 75 at the max which was it reached like 75 at the max which was cool. I'm not a I'm not a YouTuber. I'm cool. I'm not a I'm not a YouTuber. I'm cool. I'm not a I'm not a YouTuber. I'm not a live streamer. I just do this not a live streamer. I just do this not a live streamer. I just do this occasionally to share the knowledge and occasionally to share the knowledge and occasionally to share the knowledge and people enjoy the interactivity. So it's people enjoy the interactivity. So it's people enjoy the interactivity. So it's the best medium to share my work. People the best medium to share my work. People the best medium to share my work. People like seeing the live uh problem solving like seeing the live uh problem solving like seeing the live uh problem solving that I do. you think there will be some that I do. you think there will be some that I do. you think there will be some improvements to texture baking? People improvements to texture baking? People improvements to texture baking? People have requested it in the survey. They have requested it in the survey. They have requested it in the survey. They know, the devs know about it, but know, the devs know about it, but know, the devs know about it, but uh we'll see. I haven't seen any PRs uh we'll see. I haven't seen any PRs uh we'll see. I haven't seen any PRs about it. For me personally, about it. For me personally, about it. For me personally, like I don't think too much needs to be like I don't think too much needs to be like I don't think too much needs to be changed about it beyond it needs to changed about it beyond it needs to changed about it beyond it needs to output the metallic and roughness passes output the metallic and roughness passes output the metallic and roughness passes and have like a batch like every single and have like a batch like every single and have like a batch like every single pass output to a file path. that needs pass output to a file path. that needs pass output to a file path. that needs to go. Filmic's gone. No, filmic is to go. Filmic's gone. No, filmic is to go. Filmic's gone. No, filmic is still in there. It's just I prefer uh still in there. It's just I prefer uh still in there. It's just I prefer uh the other methods. So, with the baking the other methods. So, with the baking the other methods. So, with the baking again, they just need to incorporate again, they just need to incorporate again, they just need to incorporate some of the stuff that the add-ons have. some of the stuff that the add-ons have. some of the stuff that the add-ons have. The add-ons are good The add-ons are good The add-ons are good and yeah, it's just that and GPU and yeah, it's just that and GPU and yeah, it's just that and GPU acceleration and you know, all the other acceleration and you know, all the other acceleration and you know, all the other stuff. Baking just needs a few tweaks to stuff. Baking just needs a few tweaks to stuff. Baking just needs a few tweaks to make it actually usable cuz the previous make it actually usable cuz the previous make it actually usable cuz the previous versions are not not great. The pre the versions are not not great. The pre the versions are not not great. The pre the the current baking method is not great. the current baking method is not great. the current baking method is not great. It's quite ancient. Probably over a It's quite ancient. Probably over a It's quite ancient. Probably over a decade old as well. Maybe like 15 years, decade old as well. Maybe like 15 years, decade old as well. Maybe like 15 years, I would assume. It's gotten some updates I would assume. It's gotten some updates I would assume. It's gotten some updates here and there like under the hood under here and there like under the hood under here and there like under the hood under the hood changes, but nothing don't the hood changes, but nothing don't the hood changes, but nothing don't think anything user pacing, but I would think anything user pacing, but I would think anything user pacing, but I would have to check. have to check. have to check. But I would imagine with the open source development thing, with the open source development thing, with the open source development thing, you just need one person to be annoyed you just need one person to be annoyed you just need one person to be annoyed enough to learn how it works to update enough to learn how it works to update enough to learn how it works to update it. it. it. That's that's basically me with geometry That's that's basically me with geometry That's that's basically me with geometry nodes and several other developers with nodes and several other developers with nodes and several other developers with just like little bits here and there just like little bits here and there just like little bits here and there with Blender. You just need to get with Blender. You just need to get with Blender. You just need to get someone annoyed enough where they someone annoyed enough where they someone annoyed enough where they actually start messing with the source actually start messing with the source actually start messing with the source code assuming that they actually know code assuming that they actually know code assuming that they actually know what they're doing cuz uh yeah, what they're doing cuz uh yeah, what they're doing cuz uh yeah, some people just are like, "Hey AI, make some people just are like, "Hey AI, make some people just are like, "Hey AI, make Blender do this." And then they up they Blender do this." And then they up they Blender do this." And then they up they try to do a PR and it gets shot down. try to do a PR and it gets shot down. try to do a PR and it gets shot down. Don't do that. Just don't. Let's see Don't do that. Just don't. Let's see Don't do that. Just don't. Let's see another way instead of the driver and another way instead of the driver and another way instead of the driver and the key frame. Uh wait an another way the key frame. Uh wait an another way the key frame. Uh wait an another way instead of the driver instead of the driver instead of the driver to key frame the value of one and to key frame the value of one and to key frame the value of one and another key frame of two and then oh and another key frame of two and then oh and another key frame of two and then oh and then do the like infinite interpolation. then do the like infinite interpolation. then do the like infinite interpolation. Yeah, but that's very annoying to set Yeah, but that's very annoying to set Yeah, but that's very annoying to set up. That takes like probably 30 seconds up. That takes like probably 30 seconds up. That takes like probably 30 seconds versus hashtag frame. We just need the versus hashtag frame. We just need the versus hashtag frame. We just need the scene time node in the shader editor. scene time node in the shader editor. scene time node in the shader editor. That's the solution that should exist. That's the solution that should exist. That's the solution that should exist. All right. Thank you for sharing. Best All right. Thank you for sharing. Best All right. Thank you for sharing.
