People keep asking me, how do you move a People keep asking me, how do you move a People keep asking me, how do you move a real object using geometry nodes? And real object using geometry nodes? And real object using geometry nodes? And the answer is pretty simple. Triangle the answer is pretty simple. Triangle the answer is pretty simple. Triangle parenting. So in this case, the camera parenting. So in this case, the camera parenting. So in this case, the camera is parented to this triangle. And the is parented to this triangle. And the is parented to this triangle. And the triangle moves and it just works triangle moves and it just works triangle moves and it just works perfectly. So let's get this set up. So perfectly. So let's get this set up. So perfectly. So let's get this set up. So let's add in a new object like a camera. let's add in a new object like a camera. let's add in a new object like a camera. And let's add in our triangle, which in And let's add in our triangle, which in And let's add in our triangle, which in this case will be a circle. We'll set this case will be a circle. We'll set this case will be a circle. We'll set the vertices to be three. And we'll go the vertices to be three. And we'll go the vertices to be three. And we'll go and fill in the face using F. Now we can and fill in the face using F. Now we can and fill in the face using F. Now we can see we have a triangle. So, let's parent see we have a triangle. So, let's parent see we have a triangle. So, let's parent the camera to the triangle. And that's the camera to the triangle. And that's the camera to the triangle. And that's pretty simple. We just press Ctrl P and pretty simple. We just press Ctrl P and pretty simple. We just press Ctrl P and set the parenting to vertex triangle set the parenting to vertex triangle set the parenting to vertex triangle mode. Now, if we do this and move the mode. Now, if we do this and move the mode. Now, if we do this and move the triangle in edit mode, we can see that triangle in edit mode, we can see that triangle in edit mode, we can see that the location and rotation work. But the location and rotation work. But the location and rotation work. But unfortunately, the scale doesn't work. unfortunately, the scale doesn't work. unfortunately, the scale doesn't work. So, if you need that, uh, you're kind of So, if you need that, uh, you're kind of So, if you need that, uh, you're kind of out of luck. So, with this, we can now out of luck. So, with this, we can now out of luck. So, with this, we can now move this triangle and it'll just work. move this triangle and it'll just work. move this triangle and it'll just work. I also recommend just, you know, moving I also recommend just, you know, moving I also recommend just, you know, moving the camera so that it is facing the the camera so that it is facing the the camera so that it is facing the right direction. And we can go and scale right direction. And we can go and scale right direction. And we can go and scale down the triangle to make it, you know, down the triangle to make it, you know, down the triangle to make it, you know, invisible. But you could always just invisible. But you could always just invisible. But you could always just eliminate it in the render option. So eliminate it in the render option. So eliminate it in the render option. So let's go and move this triangle to let's go and move this triangle to let's go and move this triangle to match, I don't know, some instances match, I don't know, some instances match, I don't know, some instances which we have conveniently placed right which we have conveniently placed right which we have conveniently placed right over here. So let's go and use a over here. So let's go and use a over here. So let's go and use a transform geometry node. And right here, transform geometry node. And right here, transform geometry node. And right here, we can go and move the triangle however we can go and move the triangle however we can go and move the triangle however we want using this. But in this case, we want using this. But in this case, we want using this. But in this case, I'm going to use the matrix option. So I'm going to use the matrix option. So I'm going to use the matrix option. So I'm going to drag our instances into I'm going to drag our instances into I'm going to drag our instances into here. then use a sample index node to go here. then use a sample index node to go here. then use a sample index node to go and sample the instances transform and sample the instances transform and sample the instances transform matrix and we'll go and put this onto matrix and we'll go and put this onto matrix and we'll go and put this onto the object. So we'll go and use the the object. So we'll go and use the the object. So we'll go and use the instance transform just like that and instance transform just like that and instance transform just like that and we'll go and plug this into here. So and we'll go and plug this into here. So and we'll go and plug this into here. So and also remember to set it to relative and also remember to set it to relative and also remember to set it to relative and now we can see that this real object now we can see that this real object now we can see that this real object this real camera is being moved to match this real camera is being moved to match this real camera is being moved to match a geometry nodes driven object. So we a geometry nodes driven object. So we a geometry nodes driven object. So we can see that that works out quite well. can see that that works out quite well. can see that that works out quite well. And also just to verify, we can go and And also just to verify, we can go and And also just to verify, we can go and look inside the camera and we can see it look inside the camera and we can see it look inside the camera and we can see it is moving around and having a wonderful is moving around and having a wonderful is moving around and having a wonderful time. So, yep, that's how you go and time. So, yep, that's how you go and time. So, yep, that's how you go and move real objects using geometry nodes. move real objects using geometry nodes. move real objects using geometry nodes. I hope you like these shorter tutorials.

I hope they are useful and I will see I hope they are useful and I will see I hope they are useful and I will see you next time. Have a good one.
