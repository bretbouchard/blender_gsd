# Eyes - Dynamic Visual Effect System

## Project Context

**Purpose**: A procedural visual effect system for creating dynamic, animated eye effects using Blender's geometry and material nodes.

**Philosophy**:
- Eyes as moments captured in time
- Spheres within spheres, wheels within wheels
- Movement and reflection create meaning
- Scale determines perception

## Vision Statement

Create a mesmerizing visual effect system where eyes emerge, rotate, reflect, and interact in a cosmic dance. From 12 eyes to millions, each eye captures a single moment, reflecting the world or emitting focused light. The system creates a "giant sphere of spheres" that moves fluidly, with eyes blinking into existence, expanding into 3D space.

## Core Concepts

### Visual Language
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Blinking In | Eyes emerge by expanding into 3D space |
| Spheres in Spheres | Nested geometry - eyes within eyes |
| Wheels Within Wheels | Rotating elements at different speeds |
| Moment Capture | Each eye holds a single instant in time |
| Condensation | Rotating moisture/energy at outer edges |
| Heat Waves | Rippling distortion of view through the eyes |

### Physical Behaviors
- **Edge Rotation**: Center stays static, edges rotate tighter
- **Size-Speed Relationship**: Smaller eyes rotate faster, turn black when reaching "space"
- **Size-Distance Relationship**: Larger eyes move reflected locations closer
- **Glow Without Light**: Can appear luminous without self-emission
- **Halo Effect**: Giant spinning halo of light/fire surrounding the whole

### Scalability
- Minimum: 12 eyes
- Maximum: Millions of eyes
- Performance-conscious implementation

## Technical Approach

### Geometry Nodes
- Procedural eye generation with customizable parameters
- Instance-based for performance at scale
- Nested sphere construction
- Animation-ready controls

### Material Nodes
- Reflective surfaces for capturing environment
- Emissive zones for focused light emission
- Refraction for heat wave effects
- Animated material properties

### Animation System
- Rotation speeds tied to eye size
- Emergence/blink animations
- Condensation rotation at edges
- Halo pulsing and spinning
